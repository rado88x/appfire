Is anyone experiencing this issue able to post screenshots of logs showing what headers are returned when an API request is rate limited? I'm currently unable to reproduce this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
I have an API key that I've artificially rate limited to test this issue. But despite being rate limited (429 response) and not seeing the {*}access-control-allow-{*}* headers, I can still see \{*}retry-after-{*}* and {*}x-rate-limit-{*}* headers in the response.&#xd;

&#xd;
Although you can see the {*}retry-after-{*}* and {*}x-rate-limit-{*}* headers in DevTools, you won't be able to access them from your *JS code* if you make a request from different origin. This behavior is part of the browser's [CORS|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS] mechanism.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
As I wrote on the original ticket [Missing access-control-allow-origin header for 429 response - Developer and Marketplace Support - Jira Service Management:|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/34/ECOHELP-58073]&#xd;
&#xd;
Lack of the {{[access-control-allow-origin|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers]}} header prevents our code from accessing the response object.&#xd;
&#xd;
Lack of the {{[access-control-expose-headers|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers]}} header with retry-after and x-rate-limit-* headers listed does not allow us to calculate appropriate delay before the next retry.</text><author>Planyway</author></comments><comments><text>[~192198428688] Hi, I believe I've discovered the issue that was causing Trello to not set the headers correctly when returning 429.

I can confirm that both allow-origin and expose-headers are present in 429 response now.&#xd;

One more thing related to this issue. Could you please add the *retry-after* header to exposed headers as well? It works effectively on our backends, I believe it will also help reduce 429 errors on the frontend.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (no)&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
When a user deletes a space between two words in a card's title on an iOS device, the space character is correctly removed. However, instead of the cursor positioning itself at the location of the deleted space (between the two words), it automatically jumps to the end of the text. This behavior disrupts the user's editing flow, as they have to manually reposition the cursor to continue editing.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Our team is working to better understand how to reproduce the problem.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
One character (space) is deleted and the cursor is positioned to delete the next character before it.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When attempting to cut (using Command+X) a hyperlink from a card comment, the clipboard stores the card's URL instead of the original hyperlink. There is another scenario below when a description is cut (using Command+X), the clipboard only stores the card's URL instead of the card description. Both of these scenarios only happen when the starting text is formatted in any way (heading text, italic, bold, ordered or undordered list, code block, strikethrough, hyperlink). Unformatted text does not have this issue. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce (Command+X a hyperlink in a comment)&#xd;
 # Create a card and add a comment containing a hyperlink.&#xd;
 # Highlight the URL by dragging your cursor over it.&#xd;
 # Use Command+X or right-click and select "Cut" to remove the hyperlink.&#xd;
 # Paste the contents of the clipboard into any text field to view the result.&#xd;
&#xd;
This message pops-up when cutting the link:  !image-2024-10-02-10-15-22-996.png|width=426,height=107!&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The original hyperlink should be removed from the comment and available for pasting elsewhere.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The hyperlink is removed from the comment, but pasting results in the Trello card URL instead of the intended hyperlink.&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue reproduced: [^Screen Recording 2024-10-02 at 10.07.21.mov]&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the "Copy" function instead of "Cut" to retain the original hyperlink for pasting.&#xd;
h1. ^Another scenario:^&#xd;
&#xd;
Another scenario for the same bug when a description is cut from the card.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce (Command+X a formatted text in the description)&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Open an existing card.&#xd;
2. Click in the description area&#xd;
3. Select some text in that description. The first word in the selection must be bold.&#xd;
4. Perform a command-x to cut that text&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The text will disappear (as it should), and when you paste the description to another card, it should paste the exact text that you cut from the original card. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The text will disappear (as it should), but you'll see a popup message on the bottom left of the browser window that says "{*}Card Copied to Clipboard{*}"&#xd;
&#xd;
If you then paste the contents of the clipboard, you'll actually be pasting the card link, and the text you cut will be gone. &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the "Copy" function instead of "Cut" to retain the original description for pasting.</description><createDate>2024-10-02T13:19:07.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The description of this bug and the title do not correlate. The title is accurate to an issue I had, and was referenced by a support rep as a relevant issue. But the description here describes copying a URL from a comment.&#xd;
&#xd;
The titular issue affected me recently as I had attempted to cut and paste the entire contents of the description of one card into another card. The result of the paste action is a link to the source card rather than the contents of the clipboard from the cut action.&#xd;
&#xd;
It's problematic because after having performed the cut command, saved the card, and then performed the paste command in another card, the contents were presumed to be unrecoverable.&#xd;
&#xd;
I found this third-party resource that helped me recover the contents of the lost description: [https://foreverhungry.dev/posts/2021-11-24-restore-trello-card-description/]&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, depending on the complexity of the description, the contents of the description do not paste properly when using CTRL + V.

The heading element used to convey the page structure, there are few text elements which is lacking html heading mark-up.&#xd;
The text "www.npmjs.com website, "Package installation ", "Package publishing", "Package search "  and so on are not defined using heading markup.&#xd;
This resulted in screen reader users finding it difficult to understand the page content structure.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
On other subscriptions (e.g. Email), if the page has component subscriptions enabled, the notification contains a link to manage the subscription (https://&lt;pageurl>/subscriptions/&lt;subscriberID>/edit) - this allows the receiver to update the components selected for that subscription method. &#xd;
&#xd;
>> this is expected as per [https://support.atlassian.com/statuspage/docs/enable-component-subscriptions/] &#xd;
&#xd;
However, this link is missing in the payload sent to Webhooks. This means a webhook subscriber is unable to easily update their subscription without knowing to copy their subscriber ID from the unsubscribe link, and use it in the above link instead. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Ensure page has "Component Subscriptions" enabled &#xd;
 # Add a webhook subscriber &#xd;
 # Create/update an incident &#xd;
 # Check the payload sent to the webhook and notice it is missing the edit subscription link that is present in email &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
For the payload sent to the webhook endpoint to also contain the "Edit Subscription" link &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Webhook payload does NOT contain the "Edit Subscription" link &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Look at the "unsubscribe" link to find the webhooks subscriber ID (this is included in the webhook payload)&#xd;
 ** It can be found here: "unsubscribe":"http://&lt;pageURL>/?unsubscribe=&lt;{+}*subscriberID*{+}>&#xd;
 # Formulate the edit subscription link which looks like this: https://{+}*&lt;pageurl>*{+}/subscriptions/{+}*&lt;subscriberID>*{+}/edit</description><createDate>2025-03-27T03:43:47.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Users with the product admin role cannot add new pages</summary><key>STATUS-859</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STATUS-859</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

As per https://support.atlassian.com/statuspage/docs/what-user-permissions-can-i-grant/ a product admin should be able to add a new page. When checking it, product admins are not able to do so, as the option is missing. &#xd;
&#xd;
Being a member of a "product-admin" group wasn't sufficient to add a new page within the org. Only after added the user to the "org-admin" group the "+" sign was visible&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When customers try to add an app developed with the Forge framework to a sandbox site(via Marketplace) that has already been added to the production site and is paid subscription, they don't see the "Add to sandbox" option. Instead, they only get the Trial version option.&#xd;
&#xd;
This only applies to Forge-based apps, Connect-based apps do get the "Add to sandbox" option and can be used for free in the sandbox as long as they are installed in the production site as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Important NOTE:* The issue is *only* with the front end, and the backend rightly recognises the app as already paid in production, thus a free *Standard Sandbox* offering is provisioned for forge apps as well. However, in the UI, we don't get the "Add to sandbox" option.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install any forge app to a production site - Ex. Planning Poker&#xd;
 # Open the sandbox site and go "Find new apps" and try to add the same app.&#xd;
 # Observe that you get only the "Free Trial" button.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

Customers should see the "Add to Sandbox" button when trying to add the app to the sandbox site.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When running JCMA preflight, sometimes the AnonPermission preflight check description on UI is blank. However on refresh it gets updated.&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens when either JCMA is disabled/uninstalled or Jira instance restarted, and checking the details of an existing plan.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image (11).png|width=374,height=205!&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
All versions post JCMA 1.12.12 are potentially impacted&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a plan in JCMA, run preflights and save plan.&#xd;
 # Disable JCMA and then enable again.&#xd;
 # Check the saved plan details and blank description will be there.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
AnonPermission should have a description message present like the other preflights.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The description is blank.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Cause:*&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens because dashboard check was added recently in AnonPermission and UI message was updated to reflect the same. This message change is also behind a FeatureFlag. When JCMA is restarted, the in memory cache gets reset. So when checking ViewDetails, JCMA relies on getting response again from preflightCheck, but since its behind an FF and FF is not set when directly checking Plan Details, the string remains empty and UI does not show anything.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Refreshing the page or preflight resets the message correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;

The field in the Board configuration 'Hide completed issues older than' is not migrated from Server to Cloud migration.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Kanban board and Configure it&#xd;
 # In Board Configuration -General, Select a value for 'Hide completed issues older than' ({*}say 4 weeks{*})&#xd;
 # Migrate the Project along with the Board&#xd;
 # Post-migration, in the cloud the field is referred to as  "Completed issues" and the value for "Choose how long completed issues stay on your board" is by default set to *"2 weeks"*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 *  The value for 'Hide completed issues older than'  should be migrated as set in the server&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 *  The value "Completed issues" is not migrated and is set to the default value of "2 weeks" in the cloud &#xd;

&#xd;
As discussed with @[vjadhav|mailto:vjadhav@atlassian.com] and [~0da2b4edb1fb] &#xd;
&#xd;
MCS team fixed the case where estimated time with attachment is turning out lower compared to estimated time without attachment which was a bug in estimation functionality. &#xd;
&#xd;
It is important to note that the estimated time is only an approximation and cannot be made 100% accurate. The actual migration involves factors that cannot be predicted in advance. As a follow-up action, we can request the team responsible for the UI to add a disclaimer indicating that the estimated times might not be entirely accurate and are intended solely as an estimate. So as to not cause any confusion to customer. </description><createDate>2024-02-13T06:21:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi [~646205eda384] ,&#xd;

Hi everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
This is Aayushi from the JCMA team. We would like to thank you for all the comments and feedback on the bug you've been experiencing with JCMA re-opening closed sprints.&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug and the various ways it occurs (as mentioned in the Description of this bug) is due to {*}Config Drift{*}. JCMA tracks and maintains a record of the entities you have migrated (e.g workflow, custom field etc.), this functionality enables it to reduce the incidence that duplicate entities are created by linking data from entities that have previously been migrated. _*You can learn more about how JCMA links your data [here|https://support.atlassian.com/migration/docs/how-the-jira-cloud-migration-assistant-links-your-data/] &amp; [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/jira-cloud-migration-assistant-duplicates-and-tracking-entities-1063170066.html]*_&#xd;
&#xd;
In this scenario with the sprint entity if there is a *difference (drift)* in the status of the Sprint we have taken the Server/Data Center status as the source of truth which results in the JCMA behaviour you're experiencing. &#xd;
&#xd;
After careful consideration of all the scenarios and uses cases we determined the best approach to solve this bug would be to develop a feature that would enable you to choose the source of truth whenever a *Config Drift* scenario is detected. &#xd;
&#xd;
While this may not be the outcome you were expecting, changing the source of truth to Cloud may also result in another bug for use cases where the Server/Data Center status would be considered the source of truth some customers.&#xd;
&#xd;
You can monitor progress of this feature via [MIG-2100|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-2100] we have carried over all your comments and votes there as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please share any additional information about your particular use case that you think would help us prioritise building this feature.&#xd;
&#xd;
Kind regards,&#xd;
Cloud Transitions Team&#xd;

h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When migrating Projects from Server to Cloud, the migration assistant can reopen past completed Sprints in some scenarios. Some well-known scenarios are:&#xd;
 * Sprint name already exists in destination Cloud site (expected as per MIG-1339)&#xd;
 * Sprint was previously migrated under a different name after Project data changed&#xd;
 * Sprint contains cross-project issues&#xd;
 * Shared Sprints found in other Boards&#xd;
 * In phased migrations, if migrator selects on every plan to migrate "All dashboards", if a gadget/ dashboard references a sprint, although the sprint belongs to a single project board, will be exported in cross project data and the server data will take prevalence over already existing cloud data;&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
These steps only account for 1 particular scenario that is very consistent (cross-project issues):&#xd;
 # On Server site, create *Project* A with *Sprint 1* and Issues&#xd;
 # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including *Project A*&#xd;
 # On Cloud site, complete *Sprint 1*&#xd;
 # On Server site, create *Project B* with Issues. Assign an Issue to *Sprint 1*&#xd;
 # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including only *Project B*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Considering *Project A* was not in the scope of the migration, this should have no impact, OR a new *Sprint 1* should be created in {*}Project B{*}.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
*Sprint 1* from *Project A* is reopened. This is also still applicable if the Sprint was renamed in the Server site where it will update the Sprint name in the Cloud site.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
If migrating in phases with the option to migrate "All dashboards" in each phase, prior to the migration, contact Atlassian Migration Support with the result of the below query:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
SELECT&#xd;
    pp.ID AS DashboardID,&#xd;
    pp.PAGENAME AS DashboardName,&#xd;
    pc.ID AS GadgetID,&#xd;
    pc.GADGET_XML AS GadgetKey,&#xd;
    gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE AS SprintID,&#xd;
    aosp."NAME" AS SprintName,&#xd;
    aosp."START_DATE" AS SprintStartDate,&#xd;
    aosp."COMPLETE_DATE" AS SprintCompleteDate,&#xd;
    aosp."END_DATE" AS SprintEndDate,&#xd;
    aosp."CLOSED" AS SprintClosed,&#xd;
    aosp."STARTED" AS SprintStarted,&#xd;
    aosp."RAPID_VIEW_ID" AS RapidViewID &#xd;
    FROM&#xd;
       PORTALPAGE pp&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       PORTLETCONFIGURATION pc ON pp.ID = pc.PORTALPAGE&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       GADGETUSERPREFERENCE gup_sprint ON pc.ID = gup_sprint.PORTLETCONFIGURATION AND gup_sprint.USERPREFKEY = 'sprintId'&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" aosp ON gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE = aosp."ID"::text;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Atlassian support will be able to map the above result with the existing cloud data and will provide you the differences for the potentially impacted sprints. Having this information, migrator can take educated decision on whether to proceed in using the migrate "All dashboard" option with impact or not migrating dashboards (as long as all dashboards were migrated in the first migration phase). More than this, the information provided can be leveraged to modify the on premise sprints via REST/ API or database ( by setting to the on prem sprints the values existing on cloud).</description><createDate>2024-06-10T13:20:53.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update – 19 November 2024|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#deebff}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
JCMA is not able to finish running the preflights in case it contains a filter with "WAS NOT IN" or "WAS IN", and other filters have a reference to it.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install any version of JCMA greater than 1.11.0 (could be the latest one).&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Migration Assistant home, create a migration plan including all boards and filters on it&#xd;
 # Run the preflight checks&#xd;
 # Check that cross-project boards and filters preflight check failed  !image-2024-05-14-15-09-06-531.png|width=529,height=107!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Example Data used to Reproduce the issue&#xd;
 # Create a project with key KANBAN&#xd;
 # Create 4 issues for this project&#xd;
 # Create at least 4 filters with the following configuration:&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_1: filter != KANBAN_2 AND filter != KANBAN_3 AND filter != KANBAN_4 ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_2: Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 OR Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 OR Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_3: project = KANBAN AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2025-12-31 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND (resolution != duplicate OR resolution is EMPTY) AND priority in (Highest, High, Medium) AND (labels not in (frictionpoint) OR labels is EMPTY) AND status was not in (Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_4: project = KANBAN AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2023-12-31 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND Status in (Backlog,Done,"In Progress",Open,Resolved) OR project = SCRUM AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2023-01-01 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND Status was in (Backlog,Done,"In Progress",Open,Resolved) AND status in (Closed) ORDER BY key ASC, created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The preflights should be able to run successfully on this scenario.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Not include boards and filters on the migration plan, or contact Atlassian support team for additional help.</description><createDate>2024-05-14T18:19:56.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>'Create from template' macro don't point to correct template after migration with CCMA</summary><key>MIG-1872</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1872</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When migrating Confluence spaces via CCMA or Space export/import the 'Create from template' macro don't work and display the follow message when clicked on:&#xd;
&#xd;
bq.  The template selected is not available anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create local page template in space &#xd;
 # Create new page and add 'Create from template' macro, point it to page template from previous step&#xd;
 # Migrate space from Server/DC to Cloud via CCMA or via manual space export/import&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
'Create from template' macro button works on destination and a new page is created with the desired template&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking the 'Create from template' macro button causes the following message to show:&#xd;
&#xd;
bq.  The template selected is not available anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you edit the macro it'll show pointing to the first template in the list instead of the desired template.&#xd;
&#xd;
Page source points to an old Server templateid:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:xml}&#xd;
&lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name="create-from-template" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="aaaa-bbbbb-cccccc-dddddd">&#xd;

&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="templateId">123456789&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="title">Sample title&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="buttonLabel">Add template page&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Edit the macro on the page and select the desired page template that should be used and publish the change.</description><createDate>2023-12-12T18:38:11.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Custom field Customer Request Type is not migrated with JCMA and may cause JQLs to break</summary><key>MIG-1794</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1794</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Migrating from on-prem JSM, the custom field {*}Customer Request Type{*}, which is a locked field that has its custom field type as _Customer Request Type,_ deliberately gets merged with the locked custom field in Cloud, {*}Request Type{*}, which has the same custom field type _Customer Request Type._&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Create a filter that references the custom field _Customer Request Type_&#xd;
 # Create a JSM Project, add this custom field to that project via association with the project's screen&#xd;
 # Create a Jira issue on that project, and populate the _Customer Request Type_ custom field with any given value&#xd;
 # Migrate that project to an Atlassian cloud site with JCMA&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Filters have their JQL updated with the new custom field name.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Customer Request Type values gets added to the _Request Type_ custom field (seems intentional)&#xd;
 * Filters break because their JQLs reference the _Customer Request Type_ custom field (seems unintentional)&#xd;
&#xd;
The values of the {*}Customer Request Type{*}, like contexts and screens, are appended into the custom field *Request Type* in Cloud after migration.&#xd;
&#xd;
The custom field _Customer Request Type_ does not get migrated. Instead, its values are copied to the _Request Type_ custom field.&#xd;
This might cause JQL/Filters that use this custom field name to not bring the expected results.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is no automated workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;
&#xd;
Meanwhile, to fix the broken JQLs, users must edit them manually and reference the _Request Type_ custom field instead.&#xd;

This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
Migration Type: server to cloud &#xd;
&#xd;
CCMA migrates spaces with “Null” spacestatus&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Use the latest CCMA 3.9.4&#xd;
2. Create a migration plan with a space having null spacestate. This can be identified using the below query.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
select SPACEID, SPACEKEY, SPACESTATUS FROM SPACES&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
3. The Migration will run successfully without any Errors or Warnings.&#xd;
4. MAUI will show this space to be migrated successfully.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
[Navigate|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/navigate-spaces/] to view the migrated space on cloud site. This space should be listed here.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * We will be unable to see the space anywhere on the cloud UI. &#xd;
 * This is because the *spacestatus* of this space is a NULL.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
1. To fix this on the cloud site if the space is already migrated, update the *spacestatus* of the space to current by a DB update using the below query.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
update spaces set spacestatus = 'CURRENT' where spacekey = ‘&lt;SPACEKEY>’&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
2. To fix this on the Confluence server before performing the migration follow the below steps.&#xd;
 * Go to the Space with Null value spacestatus and click on Spacetools -> Overview -> Edit Space Details&#xd;
 * Select “Edit Space Details”&#xd;
 * Change the status to Current and Save it</description><createDate>2024-01-22T14:04:59.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>JCMA doesn't migrate all single project filters by default</summary><key>MIG-1642</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1642</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Data integrity checks within the migration flow causes sprint board associations stored on table/column "AO_60DB71_SPRINT"."RAPID_VIEW_ID" to not migrate as expected. This happens because the data integrity checks can overwrite specific data that impact the sprint board association to a null value when certain conditions are met.&#xd;
&#xd;
*_Steps to Reproduce_*&#xd;
 # On data center you have 2 projects, Project A and Project B&#xd;
 # Create a board and sprint (Sprint A) that includes only Project A&#xd;
 # Put a Jira issue (PROJA-1) from Project A into Sprint A.&#xd;
 # Now change the filter for Sprint A to a filter that only includes Project B.&#xd;
 # PROJA-1 has Sprint field = Sprint A, but PROJA-1 is no longer showing in Sprint A (because the filter was changed).&#xd;
 # Now migrate Project B then Project A&#xd;
&#xd;
*_Expected Results_*&#xd;
The Sprint in "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" has a valid "RAPID_VIEW_ID".&#xd;
&#xd;
_*Actual Results*_&#xd;
The Sprint in "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" has "RAPID_VIEW_ID" as null because PROJA-1 sprints are not treated as valid because they no longer point to Project A. No errors are thrown in the logs.&#xd;
&#xd;

Also think this is strange that this is not a standard feature. For use-cases outside of the standard software world, it is very common to use Jira to model and track Business Process Flows. These tend to have multiple statuses (20+ not uncommon) and multiple transitions with conditions, validators, and non-linear directions. The current way they get migrated and visualised in could make it impossible to visualise at what stage in the process the issue is really at. It takes many hours to rearrange these (our instance has 40+ complex workflows). As another user posted this cannot be done in a migration weekend, where there are already enough other technical things that need to be done.</text><author>Paddy Byrne</author></comments><comments><text>https://getsupport.atlassian.com/browse/MOVE-130653&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In business projects: the column order set by admins is ignored and columns appear grouped by their Status category (To Do, In Progress, Done) for regular users&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a business project.&#xd;
 # With an admin user, add a few extra columns/statuses with different status categories.&#xd;
 # Shift the columns/status order in the board.&#xd;
 # Access the project board with a non-admin user.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The columns are visualized in the order the admin set them.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The column reorder is only visible to the admin that made the change. For regular users, the columns are ordered first by their status category and then by their status ID apparently. For example:  !Column order comparison.png|width=413,height=216!&#xd;
&#xd;
*Notes:*&#xd;
In addition, there is another bug that prevents regular users from changing the column order for themselves, it might be connected: [JWMCLOUD-873: Regular users are not able to re-order column in Business Board|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JWMCLOUD-873]&#xd;

&#xd;
The List view is storing column configuration in browser local storage which is why they are not persisting when you change browser or log out of Jira. As an alternative, you can use the "Issues" tab in List mode which will persist your preferences - [https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/search-for-issues-in-a-project/].</description><createDate>2024-08-07T01:58:51.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The number of people affected is actually growing in out teams, however that may be possible...</text><author>Luka Meyli Gömer</author></comments><comments><text>We are experiencing the same issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem is that the individual user's settings (filters, grouping, columns etc.) are not saved on user level. They go back to defaults after the session is restored (time has passed, logged out, private mode, using another device, using another web browser).&#xd;
&#xd;
In my opinion keeping the settings on user level is a must have functionality - same as on any internet browser (e.g. chrome, edge) - if you login on any device you'll see all your favourites etc. on any pc you use.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
DVCS Synchronization Enters Infinite Loop Due to Queued Messages for Deleted Branches&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up a Jira instance with DVCS functionality enabled, using version *10.2.0* or later. (bulk sync was added in this version).&#xd;
 # Configure a DVCS repository with multiple branches, including some that will be deleted after initial synchronization.&#xd;
 # Initiate a manual soft synchronization to queue messages for all branch heads.&#xd;
 # Delete one of the branches in the GitHub repository after the initial synchronization. It's important that the branch is deleted from the repository after the message is created, but before the message queue processes it.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 - Jira should detect the deleted branch and remove or invalidate any queued messages related to it.&#xd;
 - The synchronization process should complete successfully for all existing branches without errors.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 - Jira attempts to process the message for the deleted branch, resulting in repeated failures and retries.&#xd;
 - The synchronization process for the affected repository does not complete successfully. In the UI we can confirm this by observing that the affected repositoriy is just spinning infinitely.&#xd;
 - The logs will become spammed with very frequent 404 messages for the deleted branch.&#xd;
&#xd;

h3. Workaround 1: Force stop the affected repositories.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}Force Stop and Sync Affected Repositories{*}: Manually abort the running synchronization for the affected repositories and initiate a forced synchronization.&#xd;
 - Use a {{curl}} command or Postman to send a {{POST}} request to Jira's internal API endpoint. This request will abort any running synchronization for the specified repository.&#xd;
 - *API Endpoint:*&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
POST &lt;JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/dvcs-connector-internal/1.0/repository/{id}/abortRunningSync&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 - *Example curl Command:*&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
curl -X POST -u your-username\:your-api-token \&#xd;
'&lt;JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/dvcs-connector-internal/1.0/repository/{id}/abortRunningSync'&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
This will abort the runing sync for the affected repository. Do note that this is a hard stop. Data that was queued to be processed is also dropped. On next soft sync the data should be queued again and synced properly.&#xd;
h3. Workaround 2: Revert to Previous Sync Mechanism&#xd;
&#xd;
The bulk commit sync feature in Jira 10.2.0 has a dark feature flag {{dvcs.connector.github.bulk.commit.soft.sync.disabled}} that can be toggled to revert to the previous, slower sync mechanism. This can help avoid the infinite loop issue caused by messages for deleted branches.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps:*&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Access dark feature management using the [Atlassian guide]([https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-manage-dark-features-in-jira-server-and-data-center-959286331.html]).&#xd;
2. Add dark feature {{dvcs.connector.github.bulk.commit.soft.sync.disabled}}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When an issue has a Parent Link and its issue type is changed to a type on another hierarchy level, the Parent Link data remains. Consequently, the Parent Link is still visible on the issue view with a warning icon that suggests the Parent Link violates the current Hierarchy configuration and should be updated by the user.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is worsened when an Epic Link is also present on the Issue that had the Issue Type changed. The presence of an Epic Link makes Jira automatically hide the Parent Link from the Screens and makes it harder to remove the leftover data.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue can lead to unexpected and unusual behaviour in Jira. For instance, JQL queries may produce results that differ from what is anticipated. For example, 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over the Issue hierarchy ({*}linkedIssuesOfRecursive{*}) and can return a different set of issues than Jira functions like({*}childIssuesOf{*}).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 1*&#xd;
 # Create a new issue type called 'Initiative'&#xd;
 # Configure the hierarchy to be above Epic (at the top level)&#xd;
 # Create a new issue with the issue type 'Initiative'&#xd;
 # Link an Epic to the new Initiative using the parent link&#xd;
 # Open the Epic and use More > Move to change the issue type to 'Initiative'&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 2 (inconsistent results returned from childIssuesOf(...) query)*&#xd;
 # Create a new project.&#xd;
 # Configure the hierarchy like this:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
- EpicBusiness&#xd;
-- Capability&#xd;
--- Epic&#xd;
----Story &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
A) The experienced Issue follows the below scenario ...&#xd;
 - The Capability CAP-100 has the EpicBusiness EPB-100 as Parent.&#xd;
 - The Epic EP-100 has CAP-100 as Parent&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)&#xd;
returns CAP-100 and all its child : Epic (EP-100), User Story (...), Sub-Task (...)&#xd;
&#xd;
B) A user move CAP-100 as an EpicBusiness : EPB-110&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-110)&#xd;
returns always same children as when it was CAP-100&#xd;
 - The Epic EP-100 has EPB-110 as direct Parent, an EpicBusiness ! Normally, only Capabilities should be allowed as Parent of Epic&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)&#xd;
returns always same children, including EPB-110 (ex-CAP-100) ! Normally, an EpicBusiness can not have a EpicBusiness as Parent.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is causing many inconsistencies in the users activities&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 3 (involved 3rd party plugin)*&#xd;
&#xd;
*1.* Install a 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over Issue hierarchy&#xd;
&#xd;
*2.* Create Issue Types "Initiative" and "Capability" and add them to a Project's Scheme&#xd;
&#xd;
*3.* Add the Parent Link Custom Field to all Screens on that Project (to make it easier to follow the steps)&#xd;
&#xd;
*4.* Configure the Roadmaps Hierarchy so that Initiative > Capability > Epic&#xd;
&#xd;
*5.* Create a set of Issues organized as such:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
Initiative 1&#xd;
  Capability 1&#xd;
    Epic 1&#xd;
	  Story 1&#xd;
  Capability 2&#xd;
    Epic 2&#xd;
	  Story 2&#xd;
&#xd;
Epic 3&#xd;
  Story 3&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
*6.* Create a Filter using the 3rd party app JQL function to list the Hierarchy of the top Issue, like:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
issue = "&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>" OR issueFunction in linkedIssuesOfRecursive("&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>", "is parent of")&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
*7.* Confirm all Issues under the hierarchy of "Initiative 1" are listed&#xd;
&#xd;
*8.* Change the Issue Type of "Capability 2" to Story (Move operation also works) and set it's Epic Link to "Epic 3"&#xd;
&#xd;
*9.* Reload the Filter and see "Capability 2" (now a Story) is still being listed, though it's now in the Hierarchy of "Epic 3", not under "Initiative 1"&#xd;
&#xd;
If you use Jira's native JQL functions, the Epic Link has precedence over the (invalid) Parent Link and "Capability 2" is not listed anymore:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
issue = "&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>" OR issue in childIssuesOf("&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>")&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
- The parent link will be cleared as you should be able to only link an issue to a parent issue of the _corresponding hierarchy level_ that you've configured for your plan.&#xd;
- A Move Issue with change of Type (in Roadmap Hierarchy) must break all Parent Links or be blocked while a Parent-Child link exists&#xd;
- A Move Issue between JSW Issue Types and JPO Issue Types should be follow same rule&#xd;
- The JQL childIssueOf() should return children in respect of Hierarchies. Parent Link between Issue Type in same Level hierarchy should be ignored.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * The parent link data remains and the warning below can be seen next to this field:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
This link is inconsistent with your Portfolio hierarchy.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 * The parent link can't be edited as there is still Epic Link&#xd;
 * The "Capability" Issue has a valid Epic Link which is prioritized by Jira and an invalid Parent Link which is ignored.&#xd;
 * The data is still left over in both DB tables:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
issuelink&#xd;
entity_property {code}&#xd;
* The JQL childIssueOf() return the same results after move the ticket to another parent hierarchy issue type.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h4. 1. Create an automation to remove the Parent Link&#xd;
&#xd;
Create an automation rule that will automatically clear the *Parent Link* field whenever an issue is moved to a new issue type, as explained in the KB article linked below:&#xd;
 * [Automation For Jira - How to clear the Parent Link field when an issue is moved to a new type|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1206795140]&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. 2. Remove Parent Link manually&#xd;
&#xd;
To remove the parent link: &#xd;
 * Convert the issue back to its previous issue type(e.g. Epic).&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Remove the parent link. &#xd;
&#xd;
 * Convert back to the new issue type.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. 3. Remove existing data directly from the database&#xd;
&#xd;
To clean up existing Issues' Parent Links refer to this documentation:&#xd;
 * [Searching for child or parent Issues using JQL functions report wrong results in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1282250410]</description><createDate>2017-11-28T07:03:18.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We encountered this issue as well.

&#xd;
Just created a hierarchy above Initiative and saved changes. (Didn't bother to associate isssue types or change anything else)&#xd;
&#xd;
Went to the Initiative and cleared the Parent Link field. Reverted the changes back to original state in portfolio hierarchy.&#xd;
&#xd;
Worked like a charm :)</text><author>Gowri Kumar</author></comments><comments><text>In my situation I fixed by:&#xd;
 # removing the Epic Link from the Story - which revealed the Parent Link (with the warning icon)&#xd;
 # removing Parent Link&#xd;
 # re-assigning Epic Link&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
BTW, this can't be done via Bulk Edit since, for some reason, the Issue Search and Bulk Edit recognize the fact that the Parent Link is invalid and, therefore, don't show it in search results or allow it to be set to Empty in a Bulk Edit.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Preventative medicine... make sure Epics and Stories use different screen schemes (even better, remove issue type from the screens).  That way users won't be able to turn an Epic into a Story, which is what made this issue manifest in our system.&#xd;
&#xd;
Definitely +1ing this one.&#xd;

&#xd;
Neither the issue view, issue edit nor bulk edit screens will allow me to clear the field.&#xd;
&#xd;
However the fix from Mihai Schwarz is quick and works.  You don't even need to assign an issue type to the dummy entry you create.</text><author>Richard Cross</author></comments><comments><text>*Workaround*&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If a user edits an issue (either with the edit button or bulk update) to update the issue type of an issue, Roadmap does not automatically disassociate the issue from existing parent issue even if it does not match the Roadmap hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create a hierarchy such as : L1 (Level 1 issue), L2 (Level 2 issue), L3 (Epic),...&#xd;
# Create an issue with Level 1 issue type.&#xd;
# Create 2 issues with Level 2 issue type.&#xd;
# Create 2 issues with Epic issue type.&#xd;
# Access the Roadmap plan which shows the issues.&#xd;
# Move the newly created Level 2 issues as child issue of Level 1 issue.&#xd;
# Move each of newly created Epic issues as child issue of Level 2 issues.&#xd;
# Review and publish the changes from plan.&#xd;
# Open one of the Level 2 issue in an issue view.&#xd;
# Edit the issue type of the Level 2 issue to Level 1 issue.&#xd;
# Access the plan again and we will see the Level 1 issue has an Epic issue as child issue which does not follow the Roadmap hierarchy.&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen recording: [^JPO-4277.webm] &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
* Roadmap automatically disassociate the child issue of the parent issue if the configuration is against the Roadmap's hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
* Child issue remains to be associated with the parent issue even though it's against the Roadmap's hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user filter has more than 50+ sprint names selected in the advanced JQL query, it will cause the query to be running slowly. For example:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
project in (TEST) AND sprint in (Sprint-A, Sprint-B, Sprint-C, Sprint-D and so on....)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The searching does not impact admin users.&#xd;

h3. Current Design&#xd;
&#xd;
Every time user asks for sprint we're checking if the user has access to it and it has if the user:&#xd;
* is an admin,&#xd;
* OR has access to the board&#xd;
* OR has access to any issue from this sprint.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Suggestions&#xd;
&#xd;
To fix that problem by creating a feature flag or cache the results to improve the performance in the future.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To speed up the searching process, we recommend a workaround by replacing sprint names with sprint IDs.&#xd;
&#xd;
To find the Sprint ID, please paste the sprint names and run the SQL query:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
SELECT ID, NAME FROM AO_60DB71_SPRINT WHERE NAME like '%SPRINT_NAME%';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) Replace *SPRINT_NAME* with the sprint name from the filter.&#xd;
&#xd;
Or you can find the sprint id following the [Jira Software: How to identify the ID of a sprint|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-software-how-to-identify-the-id-of-a-sprint-779159065.html] KB article.&#xd;
&#xd;
Update all the sprint names to id from the filter and then saved the filter.&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
DVCS data related to the issue should load in the Dev Panel.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Data is not loaded into the dev panel which should return either the cached existing data or the new one stored into DB after soft or hard sync.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Kanban backlog board is being used in a gadget on a dashboard, a Kanplan acknowledge section is being rendered on top of it with the following text:&#xd;
&#xd;
{quote}A bigger and better backlog has just landed&#xd;
We've created a dedicated space for you to plan in the new Kanban backlog. This board will now be a distraction-free zone for your team to focus on work-in-progress.{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
That acknowledgment has links like "Take me there", "Close", etc, and none of them are working when viewed on the dashboard. The same links work fine when the acknowledgement is viewed in the board view.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a Kanban project&#xd;
# Create a Kanban board&#xd;
# Enable Kanban feature by dragging unmapped status to the leftmost column in "Columns" configuration of the board&#xd;
# Use this board in a dashboard gadget&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Users are able to dismiss the alert when rendered on a dashboard.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Clicking on any links in the alert do nothing. Nothing is logged in the Javascript console either.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
It is possible to disable the banner altogether by modifying {{$JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/application-installation/jira-software-installation/jira-greenhopper-plugin-xxxx.jar/atlassian-plugin.xml}} and commenting out all sections referencing KanplanAcknowledge resources:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:xml}&lt;!--&lt;resource type="download" name="KanPlanAcknowledge.js" location="includes/js/rapid/ui/kanplan/KanPlanAcknowledge.js"/>-->&#xd;
&lt;!--&lt;resource type="download" name="KanPlanAcknowledge.soy.js" location="includes/js/rapid/ui/kanplan/KanPlanAcknowledge.soy"/>-->{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Save the modified file in a JAR file, and restart Jira for change to take effect.</description><createDate>2018-11-19T11:36:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>As an adminitrator of a Jira Software Server instance, the workaround worked on my Jira v7.13.0 installation.</text><author>Valsaa</author></comments><comments><text>In 7.6.16 the board will only display an error:&#xd;

&#xd;
Just wondering: As customers pay for Atlassian support, they should be able to expect a fix for such a bug (honestly, it should be found in Atlassians own tests before the software gets released) at least in the next long term release. Instead, after more than a year Atlassian is still gathering impact. What do you charge for support when so many issues do not get fixed? Most customers are more interested in reliable software than in new features.</text><author>Antje Stejskal</author></comments><comments><text>This is so crucial and basic.

Summary&#xd;
 It appears Jira Software loses viability on an issue's change history when a previously existing status is removed ( changed ) from the project's workflow. This affects the historical reporting on the various agile charts for the affected project.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Configure a workflow with the following statuses&#xd;
 ## Open -> In Progress -> Resolved -> Closed&#xd;
 # Create a sprint, add an issue from the backlog, transition every step from Open until Closed, and complete the sprint&#xd;
 # Create new workflow with the following statuses&#xd;
 ## Open -> In Progress -> Status 9&#xd;
 # Migrate workflow, map issues in Resolved and Closed to Status 9&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Agile reports are unaffected by this change&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint report show issues moved from Resolved and Closed to Status 9 as being In Progress and Removed From Sprint. Cycle Time is also incorrectly calculated for these issues as well. See attached screenshots.&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue history:&#xd;
 !issue-history.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint report:&#xd;
 !sprint-report-bad.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Notice how the Sprint report shows issue 1 as Open instead of Status 9&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
Other Agile reports may be affected from this change.&#xd;
 While the original report comes from Jira 6.4 / Jira Agile 6.7 we reproduced this problem in Jira 7.11 too.&#xd;
&#xd;
This can affect any status on the far right or far left for example if you leave out a to do status from the old workflow, the sprint report will not see that the issues were ever "started" and it will negatively affect burndown&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Modify the affect project's workflow, add changed status back, and map this status to a column in the project's agile board(respective to their position in the old board i.e. far right or far left) They do not need transitions to or from other statuses. In the example above Agile reporting is fixed by adding Resolved and Closed back to the affected project's workflow and mapping the statuses to the Done column accordingly. See attached screenshot.&#xd;

- Data can not be compared anymore to previous sprints;&#xd;
- All in all, the report information now feels 'inrealiable" to our users.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm really surprised, that this major error is still "gathering impact" and prioritized as Low. As our Jira users grow rapidly (>5000), we are continuously optimising our configuration. And we should be able to make changes - like this status change - without losing information along the way, and without users losing confidence in the tool.&#xd;

&#xd;
I think you should read this great article I found on the web: [https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-metrics]&#xd;
&#xd;
It says:&#xd;
{quote}*Summary:* _Scrum metrics are specific data points that scrum teams track and use to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Scrum teams use metrics to inform decision-making and become more efficient in planning and execution, as well as set target goals and improvement plans._&#xd;
&#xd;
“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it,” noted famous management thinker Peter Drucker. While this isn’t a statement that applies to every facet of life, it does apply to teams practicing agile scrum. By using certain metrics, scrum teams can adjust, pivot, and refine team effectiveness.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Looks like your teams don't really understand the importance of having reliable data with which to measure, track, and improve. It's possibly one the most important aspects of agile methodologies, in my (and your) opinion.

Dear Customers,&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you for taking the time to file and comment on this issue. We realize it still occurs and impacts your organization. We are now working on multiple customer requests and on new features, so we have to postpone our resolution of this issue. We’ve decided to move this issue to our long-term backlog.&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround for this bug is as follows:&#xd;
Modify the affected project's workflow, add the changed status back with no transitions, and map this status to a column in the project's agile board (respective to their position in the old board i.e. far right or far left)&#xd;
&#xd;
Please continue watching this ticket for future updates and changes in the timeline that impacts your work.&#xd;

Our testing to put the status back (and bulk migrate issues back to that old status) did not resolve the problem - and we're not happy to apply this workaround en-mass unless it works for our testing.&#xd;
&#xd;
Any other things to try?&#xd;
&#xd;
Can devs tell us what the fields that the reporting is reading off - for sure they are fields we can't see with frontend - but people might be able to fix data in the database directly - if there's documentation on how the reporting functions work.</text><author>Eric Lee</author></comments><comments><text>Found a quick and easy fix for this- at least in the server version.  Since the reports are based off the columns in the board instead of the issue statuses themselves (take a look at the cumulative report- you see column headings- not statuses) simply delete and re-create your columns.  &#xd;
&#xd;
We were standardizing projects where some had the final status of "Done" and others "Closed". We wanted them all as "Closed", so created standard schemes and moved all projects to those schemes.  Where Done was changed to Closed, we lost all of our completed issues in our reports.&#xd;
&#xd;
Went into the board settings and deleted the column for "done", and replaced it with a new column "closed".  Viola!  All of our completed issues magically re-appeared!</text><author>Michael Ballenger</author></comments><comments><text>Why has this Jira product defect has not been fixed yet?

Summary&#xd;
If completing a sprint takes longer than 60 seconds one will experience a timeout message similar to the following:&#xd;
 !release_timeout.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Bulk editing large amount of issues ( 200+ ) takes longer than 60 seconds&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# To reproduce artificially, lower the [AJAX timeout |https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-change-the-default-ajax-timeout-in-jira-server-824345485.html]to something like 10 seconds and do a sprint release on 3,000 issues&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
A more descriptive error message is displayed like the one we implemented for Kanban boards, https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-11775&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
A generic timeout error is displayed&#xd;

&#xd;
Although this bug seems minor and not really important I would like to emphasize how much it affects our users. We're using Jira as our main ALM tool. About 400 users are planning their work quarterly. Each issue is estimated original to some amount of time. Then assigned to a sprint. If estimation is higher then sprint capacity it's splitted into smaller chunks and estimations are updated accordingly. Users find themselves browsing  and searching for the original issues and correcting the original estimation manually. This makes them feel annoyed and confused. Also, a lot of times, they just forget to update the estimation and this, of course, is shown later in the sprint report. &#xd;
&#xd;
Please find a way to fix this bug, or find a better workaround for it (maybe using a script via script runner add on?..)&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;

Aeven if they were fixing this, you still have your admin to upgrade your version installed on your server. &#xd;

It's not fixed on the Cloud version, but a safe bet is to move to the cloud if you want to have this fixed.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint End date disregards date picker advanced setting when duration is not custom&#xd;
h4. Steps to reproduce the problem&#xd;
 # Configure advanced configuration datepicker as follow:&#xd;
 ** {{jira.date.time.picker.java.format : dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm}}&#xd;
 ** {{jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format : %d.%m.%y %I:%M}}&#xd;
 # Create a sprint > allocate issues&#xd;
 # Start sprint > choose duration of 1 week (any option other than custom)&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Date picker will show the date following the advanced configuration&#xd;
h4. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Date picker does not follow the date picker format&#xd;
 !notcustom.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
This problem does not happen if user choose custom duration as default:&#xd;
 !custom.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) If the user chooses non-custom duration initially, and then switch back to custom, the end date will still show the wrong format of the year.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h4. Workaround&#xd;
 # Select "Custom" duration.&#xd;
 # In some cases, user will have to remove the AM or PM in the Start/End date.</description><createDate>2017-04-14T12:44:45.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>When I switch to custom, the year still doesn't change to 2017 (still 17). Even when using the datepicker, it returns 17.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2017-04-14-16-24-48-363.png!&#xd;
&#xd;
Interestingly, I cannot start the sprint, neither in custom nor in week duration setting.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2017-04-14-16-32-16-743.png!&#xd;
&#xd;
As we were able to start sprints during some days, I suspect there is an issue with JIRA mixing up month and day. Having erroneous dates in the database (negative values) is a major issue as these need to be manually corrected (and we don't know how yet).&#xd;
&#xd;
Please escalate, this renders the sprint functionality completely broken. Thank you!&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>FrankTrautwein</author></comments><comments><text>Workaround is to create the sprint using the custom option and set it for 11 days so the end date is on a Saturday and only uses 10 working days. &#xd;

h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
This is not impacting any functionality. Just on logging&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. *Workaround*&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira Administrators can hide logging on the package by increasing logging level to ERROR.&#xd;
&#xd;
You can achieve this by adding these lines into *log4j.properties*:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
log4j.logger.com.atlassian.ozymandias  = ERROR, console, filelog&#xd;
log4j.additivity.com.atlassian.ozymandias = false&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
For changes to make an effect, Jira restart is required.&#xd;
&#xd;
The file log4j.properties is located at JIRA_INSTALL_DIR/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes (as of Jira 7.12.x)&#xd;
&#xd;
(on) Mind, this would make the log lines disappear, yet would not address the root cause.&#xd;
 The actual case had to be addressed by the plug-in vendor.</description><createDate>2016-12-08T08:19:04.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Occurs in  7.3.0 as well</text><author>Tom Moore</author></comments><comments><text>Occurs in 7.3.1 too.</text><author>plonnroth</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.1</text><author>AndreH</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.6</text><author>Robb Breckenridge</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.4</text><author>Suhas P</author></comments><comments><text>+ JIRA 7.3.6</text><author>Yevgen Lasman</author></comments><comments><text>+7.3.3</text><author>Stefan Bittner</author></comments><comments><text>+7.4.1</text><author>John Rebelos</author></comments><comments><text>+7.3.7</text><author>Christian Pascher</author></comments><comments><text>+7.4.2 (lots of logging) may wish to hide it using log4j.properties file modification...</text><author>Craig Solinski</author></comments><comments><text>+7.5.0 is also affected.

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When searching for the issues in a particular Sprint (eg Sprint 1) using the Sprint name in the JQL (eg Sprint = "Sprint 1"), it will display other issues in other sprints that start with 1 (Sprint 10, Sprint 11, Sprint 12 etc)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a few Sprints up to 10 or more, so that the Sprint name will be 10 or more.&#xd;
# Go to the Issue Navigator.&#xd;
# Search using the JQL (replace project name and sprint name accordingly with your own.) {code}project = "project name" AND Sprint = "sprint name 1"{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The Issue navigator will ONLY return issues that are in "sprint name 1".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The Issue navigator will also return issues that are in "sprint name 10", "sprint name 11", "sprint name 12" and so on.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
Search for the issues using the Sprint ID instead of the Sprint Name for more accurate results. &#xd;
&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
When changing configuration related to the calendars at *JIRA Administration > System*, some changes doesn't take place within JIRA Agile. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
JIRA Cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
Change calendar configuration format as per [Customizing the Look and Feel|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Customizing+the+Look+and+Feel], in the section Date/Time format:&#xd;
# Go to *JIRA Administration > System > Look and Feel*&#xd;
# Set Date/Time format to 24 hours yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm  &#xd;
# Check the box at the bottom to make Monday first day of the week, as per [How to set Monday as First Day of Week|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/How+to+Set+Monday+as+First+Day+of+Week+in+Date+Picker+Calendar]&#xd;
# Go to *JIRA Administration > System > General Configuration > Advanced Settings* and enter the format (_sysadmin_ only):&#xd;
- jira.date.time.picker.java.format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm&#xd;
- jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Calendars will be showing Monday as first day of the week, and time will be displayed in 24 hours format&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Calendars within JIRA Agile are still showing Sunday as first day of the week and am/pm format (see screenshots). The way date is displayed will change, but time seems to have no effect. In JIRA all changes have taken place correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
There's no workaround at the moment.</description><createDate>2015-07-28T10:44:24.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>*Please implement this soon*.

&#xd;
# Create an issue and add it to a future Sprint.&#xd;
# Notice that it shows up on the backlog view of the Rapid board&#xd;
# Now close that issue&#xd;
# Notice that it disappears from the backlog view&#xd;
# Now start the Sprint&#xd;
# Notice that the issue suddenly appears in the Sprint as a closed issue&#xd;

 The JIRA Agile column configuration screen does not properly identify the statuses which belong to the board when the conditions below are met:&#xd;
 # There is an issue type using a custom workflow, with different statuses, AND&#xd;
 # The JQL filter used by the Board references the issue type above, OR&#xd;
 ** e.g. Using the filter {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P}} will cause this problem, even though it should return the same results as the filter '_project = P_'.&#xd;
 # The JQL filter used by the board reference to text&#xd;
 ** e.g Using the filter {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext"}}&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem happens when the project/board is configured in such a way that it has multiple workflows (for different issue types). The board seems to only consider the statuses from the first workflow listed under its workflow scheme. The other statuses from the rest of workflow in the same workflow scheme will have a warning triangle indicating that the board doesn't recognize them.&#xd;
&#xd;
Moving any of the status with the warning triangle to the 'Unmapped statuses' column will make them disappear from the column configuration screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to Reproduce:*&#xd;
 # Restore the attached XML backup ([^column_issue.zip]).&#xd;
 # Navigate to Agile > Sample Scrum Project A.&#xd;
 # Go to Board > Configure.&#xd;
 # Go to Columns - All statuses are displayed and properly mapped to columns.&#xd;
 # Go to General and change the 'Working Filter SSPA' to the 'Broken Filter SSPA'.&#xd;
 # Refresh the Board configuration page for the new filter to be applied.&#xd;
 # Click on Columns again - The status which do not belong to the workflow used by the issue type "Test Issue Type" will have a warning triangle with the message below:&#xd;
 "This status is not available in any of the workflows used by this board. To remove, drag it to unmapped statuses where it will no longer be available."&#xd;
 # Dragging any of those statuses to the *Unmapped Statuses* column will make the status disappear from the column configuration screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround*&#xd;
 Using the sample filter above&#xd;
 * {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P}} and changing it to {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P and issuetype in (standardIssueTypes(),subTaskIssueTypes())}}, which yields the same results seems to resolve the problem.&#xd;
 * {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext"}} is to be changed to {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext" AND issuetype in (standardIssueTypes(),subTaskIssueTypes())}}</description><createDate>2014-12-26T17:32:15.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Could the filter be changed to just 'project = P'? This should resolve the problem as well.</text><author>David Tang</author></comments><comments><text>We experience a similar issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
When we added the following to our Scrum Board filter:&#xd;
OR issuetype in (Enhancement, Defect, "Related Defect") &#xd;
&#xd;
all statuses not pertaining pertaining to Enhancement, Defect or "Related Defect" issue types were not available for mapping to board columns. Note that it was an "OR"  condition, and other issue types were returned from the filter. In our case, we had a "Task" issue type with a status of "In Progress" that was not available for mapping once we put in that clause. &#xd;
&#xd;
To work around this, we temporarily removed that clause from the filter, mapped the "In Progress" status into a Scrum board column, and then added the clause back in. The Scrum configuration is giving us a warning that the "In Progress" status is not used by any workflow (even though it also notes there are 12 issues in that status), but the status mapping is persisting and working. </text><author>Robert Ramirez</author></comments><comments><text>We're seeing exactly what Robert R. is seeing. The workaround he describes in the last paragraph worked for us and we see the same warning (even though it shows there are x amount of issues in that status).</text><author>Shaunt Kojabashian</author></comments><comments><text>I raised the same issue GHS-23202 and we found a work around using the sub filter.</text><author>Jamie Cole</author></comments><comments><text>Good point Jamie - to be clear this was on a scrum board for us (so no sub-filter).</text><author>Brian Keefe</author></comments><comments><text>This is happening to us as well. We use a custom field to define different scrum teams that work within the same Jira project. So our filter is "project = P and 'team name'= XYZ OR project = P and issuetype = Epic". Since multiple teams can work on one Epic, we don't want to restrict Epics to one team, and Epics have a simpler workflow than the stories, so the available mapped statuses only showed the Epic statuses&#xd;
It seems that the board is filtering the statuses to the least common denominator of specified issue types (even in an OR statement)&#xd;
The workaround did work for a temporary fix, but I do think that this should be higher than minor</text><author>Courtney Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>-</text><author>Courtney Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>We face the same problem.

Our queries referenced the project. In our case, we have a project with issue types that are tied to one of four workflows. Two workflows have custom statuses.

The Sprint Report recognizes the issues but shows them as Issues Removed From Sprint. &#xd;
&#xd;
Based on the comments above, I edited the queries to specify each issue type in the project. The custom statuses now appear as unmapped statuses and can be associated with columns on the board. The issues now appear in all three modes.&#xd;

 </text><author>Chris Mitchell</author></comments><comments><text>The same problem occurred recently in one project that had only two workflows (one of them was the {color:#205081}_The default JIRA workflow_{color} which is read-only). An issue was set to status {{Reopened}} from {{Closed}} but did not appear in the Agile board of the project. The JQL of the filter was &#xd;
 {{project = &lt;projectkey> ORDER BY Rank ASC}}&#xd;
&#xd;
In the respective board configuration one could not see the status Reopened to be chosen for any column. The solution was - as mentioned above - to add the issue types.&#xd;

Is this a caching issue? I do not think that this an issue on behalf of the index because re-indexing did not help as well.&#xd;

&#xd;
I don't know if I have the same problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
The project using custom and standard issue types, custom workflow and custom statuses.&#xd;
&#xd;
The JQL is the following: &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Project in ("P") AND labels in (L) AND status not in (Closed, Resolved) OR key in (P-6577, P-6593) ORDER BY Rank ASC&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
For this, I got 13 JQL, some of are in the status: _Tested_. This status not appearing at the Kanban column mapping page.&#xd;
&#xd;
Just to review the issue, I create the same JQL (saved to another name), with a different kanban board and the _possible mapping statuses are different_ - but there is no _Tested_ again. &#xd;
&#xd;
Reindex, restart, did not help.&#xd;
&#xd;
Should I create a support ticket for you to investigate this, or it may be the same issue?&#xd;

Best: Peter</text><author>Peter Cselotei - Lupus Consulting Zrt.</author></comments><comments><text>I don't see this issue having to do with filters. For me it seems to be workflow scheme related.&#xd;
&#xd;
In some cases, it seems that when you have a workflow scheme with a workflow assigned to one issue type and one to "all unassigned", the default workflow is not being picked up by the agile boards. The workaround is to go to the workflow scheme and instead of using "all unassigned", specifically assign all other issue types to that worfklow. Actually assigning even one issue type will cause the workflow to be picked up.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm not entirely sure why this happens as it doesn't seem to happen every time but it's definitely the boards not picking up the workflow for "all unassigned issue types".</text><author>Evangelos Vrocharis</author></comments><comments><text>We have noted this in JIRA Software 7.1.6.

&#xd;
Is there any timeline on when this issue will be addressed?</text><author>Raj Vora</author></comments><comments><text>Issue seems to occur in Jira Server 8.0.2 as well</text><author>Maciej Tkaczyk</author></comments><comments><text>I think I ran into this failure mode as well.&#xd;
* I had a project without a workflow scheme, which seems to map all issue-type names to the default&#xd;
* I created a workflow scheme and mapped a single issue-type name to a custom workflow&#xd;
&#xd;
Then the board refused to acknowledge the existence of the new status in the custom workflow&#xd;
* the new status does not show up as unmapped on the board=>columns settings&#xd;
* if I transition an issue to the new status, it simply disappears from the board (because it is not mapped, and apparently not mappable)&#xd;
&#xd;
I tried modifying the board filter to include another project, which then enabled the capture of some new status, but only from the new project.&#xd;
I deleted the project I care about, saved; then added back, saved.  Still no cigar&#xd;
Next will attempt some of the suggestions from earlier commentators' (modifying the filter to explicitly capture status details)&#xd;
&#xd;
...&#xd;
h3. Solved&#xd;
I managed to solve this by a seemingly trivial modification of the filter.&#xd;
* was: this AND that OR other AND another&#xd;
* changed to explicitly group: (this AND that) OR (other AND another) &#xd;
&#xd;
That did the trick - picked up all the previously-unmapped status in every workflow, and I was able to map the new one that I cared about using.  Also note: jira still sees these explicit groupings as redundant, and ultimately deletes the parentheses in the saved filter query.  i.e., there is no actual evidence remaining after you save the new and explicitly-grouped filter query.  Next time you view it, the explicit grouping is omitted.  But the act of having done it seems to tickle the failure-mechanism in a way that provides for an effective work-around.  It hints that the underlying root-cause is a bug with the JQL parser.</text><author>Mark Caruso</author></comments><comments><text>I found that if there are issues with 2 different workflows involved but they share a common status, that the board will "decide" which issue workflow to map the status to and only allow to drag/drop transition an that issue and not others. &#xd;
&#xd;
For example: my filter finds Stories and Sub-Tasks. The workflow is different for the 2 issue types, but both have a status of "In Progress". I found that "In Progress" works for Sub-Tasks and I can drag them from 'New' to 'In Progress'. But I can't drag the Story from 'Backlog' to 'In Progress' - I have to edit the story and transition it and then it shows up on the board 'In Progress'&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Keith Lanier</author></comments><comments><text>Solution by Mark - changed to explicitly group: (this AND that) OR (other AND another) solved the problem for us. But the user had 80 filters in 80 boards and he has to change all of them.&#xd;
&#xd;
When will the fix be out? Its still there in Jira 8.5.</text><author>Divya TV</author></comments><comments><text>Your suggested work around did not work, but making my query super simple, saving it, and then editing again to re-complexify it worked like a charm.</text><author>Tomi Bates</author></comments><comments><text>I also ran into this issue. At least I think I did. My project contains the issuetypes Improvement, Task and Sub-Task. The kanban board filter query used to be project = p ORDER by rank which resulted in no status being shown in the board configuration at all. Chaging it to project = p AND issuetypes in (standardIssueTypes(), subTaskIssueTypes()) worked. &#xd;
&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When attempting to create a new board or update a saved filter in the existing board, the user may be unable to retrieve the shared filter depending upon where it is returned in the search results.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create the following saved filters:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Cash Management - A&#xd;
Cash Management - B&#xd;
Cash Management - C&#xd;
Cash Management - D&#xd;
Cash Management - E&#xd;
Cash Management - F&#xd;
Cash Management - G&#xd;
Cash Management - H&#xd;
Cash Management - I&#xd;
Cash Management - J&#xd;
Cash Management - K&#xd;
Cash Management - L&#xd;
Cash Management - M&#xd;
Cash Management - N&#xd;
Cash Management - O&#xd;
Cash Management - P&#xd;
Cash Management - Q&#xd;
Cash Management - R&#xd;
Cash Management - S&#xd;
Cash Management - T&#xd;
Cash Management - U&#xd;
Cash Management - V&#xd;
Cash Management - W&#xd;
Cash Management - X&#xd;
Cash Management - Y&#xd;
Cash Management - Z&#xd;
Man ABC&#xd;
Man Man&#xd;
Man_Man&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
# Create a new JIRA Agile board from an existing Saved Filter.&#xd;
# Attempt to enter "Man Man" or "Man_Man".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filters are returned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filters are not returned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
It appears that there is a limitation in the number of results that the drop-down can return, and if the filter is returned after those results it does not appear. If all the 'Cash Management' filters do not exist, 'Man_Man' and 'Man Man' will appear.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Rename the filter something else temporarily, such as A Man ABC, and then use that as it will appear at the top of the list.</description><createDate>2014-10-31T14:42:27.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Our Agile board already upgraded to version 6.6.13 and it wasn't resolve the issue.</text><author>Treethawat Thanawachiramate</author></comments><comments><text>We are also impacted by this issue.

Thanks,</text><author>Nguyễn Hải Vân</author></comments><comments><text>Dear all,&#xd;
&#xd;
Just change the filter name to a unique one and create Board then change the name again :). &#xd;
&#xd;
Like: I can't search for saved filter named AAAA_TASK_DONE then i change its name to U1NY ==> Create board with U1NY, then rename U1NY to AAAA_TASK_DONE.&#xd;
&#xd;
I do know this problem will occur again and again and we all do not know when will this problem be solved so just consider above solution as a workaround way&#xd;

It looks like the bug is triggered by using special characters in the title of your jql filter.

&#xd;
It seems if you also create around 20 Agile Boards all beginning with the same string, and including special characters like hyphen or underscore, a similar bug manifests in that the drop-down doesn't list some of the Agile Boards at all (the list gets truncated somehow).&#xd;
&#xd;
Ex: Create agile boards ABC_one, ABC_two, ABC_three, ABC_four, etc. and the Issue Source drop-down (in Portfolio) stops listing any boards after ABC_twenty.</text><author>Jeffrey Thornsen</author></comments><comments><text>Yes, I also got same issue.

&#xd;
Had to remove the special character - from the filter name to workaround this issue.</text><author>Missy Ann Mathews</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Atlassian Team,&#xd;
&#xd;
We faced the same issue using Jira Server 8.13.0.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our Jira users use many filters, and therefore decided to name them using special patterns. For example,&#xd;
{quote}tsspe.ph3.ssp.planning.long.all_tasks&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
, where _tsspe.ph3.ssp_ is a filter prefix. And there are many filter starting from this prefix (let it be 50).&#xd;
&#xd;
And filter from example above is not appearing while creating or editing Kanban/Scrum Board. Copy-pasting full filter name, trying to populate it char by char do not help.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although, it is still available while creating/editing gadgets.&#xd;
&#xd;
As mentioned above, workaround is to rename the whole filter to something unique, add it to a board, and then rename it to its initial name. &#xd;
&#xd;
But this is odd and causes additional effort from teams' side.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please take a look at this issue.</text><author>Artem Tikhobaev</author></comments><comments><text>This is also impacting our environment, as users heavily rely on searches and shared filters. &#xd;
&#xd;
Please give some priority to this. Thanks!&#xd;

Jira 8.5.3 - Datacenter</text><author>Paulo Salvador</author></comments><comments><text>Paulo - I've been frustrated by this issue as well... but saw on another thread (which I can't find the link) that the best workaround is to do the following;&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
 # Create your query w/ the exact parameters you want, but add a single quotation mark at the beginning of the query name ("QueryName). By doing that ("QueryName) your query will come up as one of the first items on the search.&#xd;
 # Go to the board configuration ('General and filter') page &amp; try to find your query in the 'Saved Filter' section (it should be right at the top).&#xd;
 # Once you've found it, select it and leverage it for your board.&#xd;
 # Then go back to your issue queue ("QueryName) and remove the " at the beginning of your query name (since you were able to find it - and it's no longer required :) ).&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Hope the steps above helps...

Currently I'm using the workaround of saving the filter as A0, A1 etc but that will only work up to 15 boards (=number of filters listed in the "Saved filter" dropdown). We're on Jira Cloud.&#xd;
&#xd;
The way our teams and initiatives are set up, we will soon exceed that number (and I can confirm that the board is impacted once the associated filter drops off the "Saved filter" dropdown list)</text><author>Siva Chandrasekaran</author></comments><comments><text>This cost us an hour too.

&#xd;
I've just created a copy of the board (just not to spend time for configuring from scratch). I've edited a filter and saved it as a new one... BUT I can't use it cause it does not appear in a drop-down list and I CAN'T create a new filter for an existing board cause it only allows me to edit saved filter which is currently used by the board.&#xd;

Having this fixed or not makes a big difference:  if not fixed, every Program Increment I must manually re-create a set of some 16 issues, rather than clone and tweak them for the new PI.  These represent a standard set of things we must do each PI. The difference is less than an hour vs. a full day of work.&#xd;

 * Actual: Get error, "cannot clone issue, please check your connection"&#xd;
&#xd;
I also noticed that this issue was completed in a sprint which is now closed, but the sprint value isn't showing in the main field-- it looks blank, with the "+1" for being in a closed sprint. That seems strange to me, and I'm pretty sure that didn't used to happen.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
ETA: In our case, it is because we had a validation on the issue that required the affects version field, and the value in the original ticket had an archived fix version. We were able to get around this by unarchiving that version for the purposes of the clone, and then editing from there.

&#xd;
When planning team-level issues in the app, users select a series of Jira sprints for each Increment. This means that the app shows the issues from those sprints, and issues planned in Easy Agile Programs will be added to those sprints in Jira. &#xd;
&#xd;
The app also maintains two [custom fields|https://help.easyagile.com/easy-agile-programs/programs-custom-fields] for these issues based on these sprints. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Because cloned issues incorrectly receive sprint values, the app assumes that the issues should be in these sprints. It will show these cloned issues in the given sprints, and they'll also appear in JQL searches using the associated custom field. &#xd;
&#xd;
Given the app uses sprints from Jira as a "single source of truth", we're unable to correctly handle cloned issues with incorrect sprint fields. &#xd;

I have found that _cloning a single Story_ gives you the choice to include sprint values or not.  But yeah, once the deed is done, there is no way to go back and clean it up.  Haven't tried the bulk-edit workaround in a while, but it wasn't working 3 years ago when I tried it.</text><author>will.cummings</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Any gadget sends header limit error when the filter calls around 430 issues</summary><key>JSWCLOUD-20506</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-20506</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
Pie chart gadget sends header limit error when the filter calls around 430 issues.&#xd;
When clicking on any segment of the pay chart Jira sends all the called issues through the URL, if these are more that 430 the user receives a "header too large error"&#xd;
&#xd;
Problem is reported for other gadgets as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a filter with a JQL like issue in (ISS-1,ISS-2,ISS3,ISS-4...........) with more than 430 issues&#xd;
 # Create a workload pie chart gadget and use the previously created filter&#xd;
 # Click on a segment of the pie chart&#xd;

To display the information or one error indicating what is the problem&#xd;

A 400 bad request header too large error is displayed&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available&#xd;
&#xd;
In case that search does not work, it is possible to try a different approach:&#xd;
* Create a new filter and refer to the existing filter. e.g filter_new = &lt;filter used in the dashboard>&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When saving an attribute value using comma as the decimal separator, the separator is removed, leading to a wrong value. The problem is inverted (dot is removed) when using locales that default to comma (such as Dutch or German).&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Modality 1 - English locale*&#xd;
 # Create an object type with a float attribute.&#xd;
 # Give it any value with a dot decimal separator, such as 1.5.&#xd;
 # In the list view, edit the value to use a comma as the decimal separator, such as 1,5.&#xd;
 # The separator is removed and the value is saved as 15.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Modality 2 - German locale*&#xd;
 # Create an object type with a float attribute.&#xd;
 # Give it any value with a comma decimal separator, such as 1,5.&#xd;
 # In the list view, edit the value to use a dot as the decimal separator, such as 1.5.&#xd;
 # The separator is removed and the value is saved as 15.&#xd;
&#xd;
(In the object edit view, the issue was not reproducible. In this case, the separator is replaced by a dot or comma, depending on the locale, but the value is not modified).&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets should fully respect the usage of the default decimal separator, as some locale settings use commas instead of dots (for example, Dutch and German). Editing of float attributes should be saved correctly, and the values should also be consistently displayed depending on the locale.&#xd;
&#xd;
In previous versions, the error message "Number is not valid (Float)" would be displayed. Apparently, the "fix" on bug [JSDSERVER-15703|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-15703] resulted in this new behaviour.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The value is modified, as the separator is lost.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use a dot or comma as a decimal separator, depending on the case.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using the Assets Confluence Macro to display a list of objects from an object schema in Jira, hovering over attributes referencing other objects results in a pop-up. This pop-up is broken in version 9.2 of Confluence, showing only a grey box. In previous versions of Confluence, such as 8.5, the pop-up displays the correct information about the object.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Link Confluence and Jira.&#xd;
 # Install the Assets Confluence Macro in Confluence.&#xd;
 # Create a sample object schema in Jira. For test purposes, you can use the default Assets IT Service Management project with sample data in JSM.&#xd;
 # Create a page in Confluence and add the macro.&#xd;
 # Load all objects from the object schema on the page.&#xd;
 # Find an object that contains an attribute referencing other objects, such as Business Service Owner in the sample schema.&#xd;
 # Hover over an entry of this attribute type, such as the example "Wes Shults" for object "TESTITSM-100".&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Few Asset objects are currently missing from the Jira UI, and the clean reindex process fails due to an SQLException. Furthermore, the Jira assets custom field is generating an error: "Error rendering ‘com.atlassian.jira.jira-view-issue-plugin:details-module’."&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
JSM version 10.3.3 is configured with Oracle Database Server 19.26.0.0.0 and Oracle JDBC Driver 19.3. Users have reported that certain objects are missing in the user interface, and the asset clean reindex operation fails with an error. The Atlassian Jira logs are showing a recurring error: {{java.sql.SQLException: Cannot extract column 23 for type java.lang.Long}}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets clean reindex should be completed without any errors. There should not be any objects missing in the schema, and the assets custom field should accurately display the objects.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The presence of the field Due Date in a project's screens causes a null pointer exception in a clone action automation involving an Assets field copying a value from the trigger issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a sample object schema and a few objects.&#xd;
 # Create a sample project.&#xd;
 # Create an Assets object custom field, associate it with the object schema and add it to the project.&#xd;
 # In the screens for the project, add the field Due Date.&#xd;
 # In the project, create an automation rule:&#xd;
 ** When: Manually triggered&#xd;
 ** Then: Clone issue into (Same project, same issue type, Assets field "Copy Assets Field from Trigger issue")&#xd;
 ** Name it something like "Assets Clone Issue".&#xd;
 # Create a new issue in the project and add an object to the Assets field.&#xd;
 # Click on More > Assets Clone Issue. A message will state the rule was executed successfully.&#xd;
 # Go to the automation audit logs and check that the rule failed with the following error:&#xd;
** {code:java}&#xd;
Unexpected error executing rule:&#xd;
java.lang.NullPointerException&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Now, remove the Due Date field from the project screens.&#xd;
# Try the clone action again. It will work.&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) Recent reports indicate that, similar to the 'Due Date' field, any field primarily a date type that remains empty can result in a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) error. This occurs when using the clone/create option, which involves an operation to copy the values of Asset fields within the Automation rule (A4J).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is cloned successfully.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The automation rule fails.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
If only the Due Date or any other removable field is involved, it could be removed from the issue view. However, if the situation involves essential custom fields that must be copied, it is advisable to implement an IF condition in the rule to verify the value of these specific fields for the time being.</description><createDate>2025-03-19T15:52:01.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>The creation or editing of assets objects fails due to a NullPointerException.</summary><key>JSDSERVER-16066</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-16066</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets have a limit on the number of object attributes set to the Java integer limit of 2,147,483,647. When the number of object attributes exceeds this limit, the code will fail with a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) when new objects are created or when additional attributes are added to existing objects.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
A straightforward method to replicate this issue is to check the maximum ID in the AO_8542F1_IFJ_OBJ_ATTR table or the sequence AO_8542F1_IFJ_OBJ_ATTR_ID_seq, ensuring it exceeds the value of 2,147,483,647.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Asset object creation, editing, and deletion should function without encountering any NullPointerException.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An incomplete and non-descriptive label such as "Edit" is provided for the button.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the JSM DC Help Center instance.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "Requests" button and expand it.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "All requests" and activate it.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the mentioned button.&#xd;
 # Listen and note that the button's label is incomplete and non-descriptive.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Non-descriptive label screen recording.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate through the "Requests" page, they encounter an incomplete and  non-descriptive label, such as "Edit" for the button.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users may not fully understand the button's purpose.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The screen reader should announce unique and descriptive labels for buttons to ensure users can easily understand their purpose.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this case, update the value of the "aria-label" attribute to "Edit visible columns" to provide a clear and specific description of the button’s function.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Note: Before implementing the label for this control, please consult with the content design team to determine the best label for this approach.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Reconfiguring the automation action to utilize an HTTP Request or executing a Groovy script can serve as a viable workaround, if feasible.</description><createDate>2025-02-21T02:52:22.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>SLA does not stop if the "Resolution" has been set twice within a workflow transition</summary><key>JSDSERVER-16048</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-16048</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
SLA does not stop if the "Resolution" has been twice in the same workflow transition.&#xd;
For example, setting a "Resolution" field through workflow transition post function, whilst closing the issue through REST endpoint and setting the "Resolution" value within.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Modify used workflow and add a post function to set Resolution field (e.g. to "Done"). Publish the workflow&#xd;
# Create a SLA that has Stop condition "Entered Status: Done"&#xd;
# Create a JSM issue that has the SLA from step 2 applied, and running once the issue is created&#xd;
# Close a request through REST endpoint [for issue transition| https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/9.12.0/#api/2/issue-doTransition]. Make sure to include "Resolution" value "Done" in the REST request body.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The SLA stops, regardless if the issue has been closed through REST request or through UI.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The SLA keeps running once the issue has been closed through REST endpoint.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h5. Workaround 1&#xd;
One needs to make sure that the "Resolution" value is set only once:&#xd;
* Through Workflow screen pop-up,&#xd;
* Through Workflow post-function,&#xd;
* or through REST request.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Workaround 2&#xd;
Move the post function step to after the issue history event, then the problem can be avoided as JSM will see the original history item.&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
When moving issues with Asset Custom Fields that have Filter Issue Scope defined, it fails to move the issue due to error {*}Could not find Asset object/s{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue does not occur in JSM 5.12.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
JSM 10.x&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Import object schema [^jsm-error-move-issue-obj-sche_2025-02-13T02_14_04.814Z.zip]&#xd;
 ** The object schema contains 4 objects:&#xd;

 # Create 2 Asset custom fields and associate them with Create/View screens:&#xd;
 ** Product:&#xd;
 *** !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 ** Model:&#xd;
 *** !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Create a ticket with the Product and Model fields filled:&#xd;
 ** !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Move this ticket to another issue type in the same project:&#xd;
 ** !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In JSM 5.12 (Jira 9.12), the Move Issue screen does not prompt updating the Model field:&#xd;
 * !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
This is expected as both Product and Model are not required fields.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In JSM 10 (Jira 10), the Move Issue screen prompts updating the Model field:&#xd;
 * !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
After selecting a value from the dropdown menu, it prompts error *Could not find Asset object/s* and the Move Issue process can't proceed:&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The content such as "Reference depth:", "Inbound References", "The max. number of Inbound References from the same Object Type..." and so on is marked up as description list unnecessarily. As a result, screen reader users found it difficult to understand the content structure.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen reader should announce the content as plain text for their users.&#xd;

Remove description list from the mentioned content and code it within &lt;div> element. In addition, if required CSS can be used to maintain the presentation of the page if required.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the users perform a valid “Search” operation in the “What do you need help with?” input field, search results are getting updated below the respective input field and for invalid search operations the message such as "No matching search results" displayed on the page which is not announced by screen reader. The programmatic means of identifying the presence of search result messages and suggestions are not used, so assistive technologies such as screen readers are not able to alert users to the presence of the status message/search results. Although this interaction is easier to understand for sighted users, it is not intuitive for the visually impaired.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes&#xd;
 * Ensure that the search results/status messages that become available when the user search for inputted data in the “What do you need help with?” input field should get announced by the screen reader.&#xd;
 * Provide the aria-live region for the search result message such as "No matching search results" which becomes available when the user performs an invalid search operation.&#xd;
 * Screen reader users should be notified when the suggestions get updated in the below along with the count of suggestions. For eg: “ 4 results found” Live regions can be used to achieve this behaviour.&#xd;
 * If this is not feasible, a hidden instruction should be announced (when the search input receives focus), notifying the users of the dynamic change. For eg: Typing letters in the search input fields update the search results, press the tab key to view the list of suggestions.”.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using Jira with German locale, the behavior for editing float values is not consistent.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up a Jira environment with *German* [locale.|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/change-locale-for-jira-server-314450433.html]&#xd;
 # Create a test object schema.&#xd;
 # For any object, create an attribute of type {*}float{*}.&#xd;
 # When adding or editing a value for a float attribute in the *Object Schema* view, if you add the number using a comma (the standard for German locale), the error message "{_}Value is not valid (Float){_}" will be shown. The error does not happen if a dot is used instead of a comma, but the value will be displayed correctly with the comma.&#xd;
 # When adding or editing a value for the same attribute in the *Object* view, however, it is possible to do so using a comma *OR* a dot. However, the value is then displayed with a dot.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets should fully respect the German locale settings and allow editing of float attributes with a comma. The values should also be consistently displayed with a comma.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * When adding or editing a value for a float attribute in the Object Schema view, if you add the number using a comma (the standard for German locale), the error message "Value is not valid (Float)" will be shown. The error does not happen if a dot is used instead of a comma, but the value will be displayed correctly with the comma.&#xd;
 * When adding or editing a value for the same attribute in the Object view, however, it is possible to do so using a comma OR a dot. However, the value is then displayed with a dot.&#xd;
