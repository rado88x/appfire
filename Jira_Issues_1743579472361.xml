Is anyone experiencing this issue able to post screenshots of logs showing what headers are returned when an API request is rate limited? I'm currently unable to reproduce this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
I have an API key that I've artificially rate limited to test this issue. But despite being rate limited (429 response) and not seeing the {*}access-control-allow-{*}* headers, I can still see \{*}retry-after-{*}* and {*}x-rate-limit-{*}* headers in the response.&#xd;

&#xd;
Although you can see the {*}retry-after-{*}* and {*}x-rate-limit-{*}* headers in DevTools, you won't be able to access them from your *JS code* if you make a request from different origin. This behavior is part of the browser's [CORS|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS] mechanism.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
As I wrote on the original ticket [Missing access-control-allow-origin header for 429 response - Developer and Marketplace Support - Jira Service Management:|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/34/ECOHELP-58073]&#xd;
&#xd;
Lack of the {{[access-control-allow-origin|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers]}} header prevents our code from accessing the response object.&#xd;
&#xd;
Lack of the {{[access-control-expose-headers|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers]}} header with retry-after and x-rate-limit-* headers listed does not allow us to calculate appropriate delay before the next retry.</text><author>Planyway</author></comments><comments><text>[~192198428688] Hi, I believe I've discovered the issue that was causing Trello to not set the headers correctly when returning 429.

I can confirm that both allow-origin and expose-headers are present in 429 response now.&#xd;

One more thing related to this issue. Could you please add the *retry-after* header to exposed headers as well? It works effectively on our backends, I believe it will also help reduce 429 errors on the frontend.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (no)&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
When a user deletes a space between two words in a card's title on an iOS device, the space character is correctly removed. However, instead of the cursor positioning itself at the location of the deleted space (between the two words), it automatically jumps to the end of the text. This behavior disrupts the user's editing flow, as they have to manually reposition the cursor to continue editing.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Our team is working to better understand how to reproduce the problem.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
One character (space) is deleted and the cursor is positioned to delete the next character before it.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When attempting to cut (using Command+X) a hyperlink from a card comment, the clipboard stores the card's URL instead of the original hyperlink. There is another scenario below when a description is cut (using Command+X), the clipboard only stores the card's URL instead of the card description. Both of these scenarios only happen when the starting text is formatted in any way (heading text, italic, bold, ordered or undordered list, code block, strikethrough, hyperlink). Unformatted text does not have this issue. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce (Command+X a hyperlink in a comment)&#xd;
 # Create a card and add a comment containing a hyperlink.&#xd;
 # Highlight the URL by dragging your cursor over it.&#xd;
 # Use Command+X or right-click and select "Cut" to remove the hyperlink.&#xd;
 # Paste the contents of the clipboard into any text field to view the result.&#xd;
&#xd;
This message pops-up when cutting the link:  !image-2024-10-02-10-15-22-996.png|width=426,height=107!&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The original hyperlink should be removed from the comment and available for pasting elsewhere.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The hyperlink is removed from the comment, but pasting results in the Trello card URL instead of the intended hyperlink.&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue reproduced: [^Screen Recording 2024-10-02 at 10.07.21.mov]&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the "Copy" function instead of "Cut" to retain the original hyperlink for pasting.&#xd;
h1. ^Another scenario:^&#xd;
&#xd;
Another scenario for the same bug when a description is cut from the card.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce (Command+X a formatted text in the description)&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Open an existing card.&#xd;
2. Click in the description area&#xd;
3. Select some text in that description. The first word in the selection must be bold.&#xd;
4. Perform a command-x to cut that text&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The text will disappear (as it should), and when you paste the description to another card, it should paste the exact text that you cut from the original card. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The text will disappear (as it should), but you'll see a popup message on the bottom left of the browser window that says "{*}Card Copied to Clipboard{*}"&#xd;
&#xd;
If you then paste the contents of the clipboard, you'll actually be pasting the card link, and the text you cut will be gone. &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the "Copy" function instead of "Cut" to retain the original description for pasting.</description><createDate>2024-10-02T13:19:07.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The description of this bug and the title do not correlate. The title is accurate to an issue I had, and was referenced by a support rep as a relevant issue. But the description here describes copying a URL from a comment.&#xd;
&#xd;
The titular issue affected me recently as I had attempted to cut and paste the entire contents of the description of one card into another card. The result of the paste action is a link to the source card rather than the contents of the clipboard from the cut action.&#xd;
&#xd;
It's problematic because after having performed the cut command, saved the card, and then performed the paste command in another card, the contents were presumed to be unrecoverable.&#xd;
&#xd;
I found this third-party resource that helped me recover the contents of the lost description: [https://foreverhungry.dev/posts/2021-11-24-restore-trello-card-description/]&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, depending on the complexity of the description, the contents of the description do not paste properly when using CTRL + V.

The heading element used to convey the page structure, there are few text elements which is lacking html heading mark-up.&#xd;
The text "www.npmjs.com website, "Package installation ", "Package publishing", "Package search "  and so on are not defined using heading markup.&#xd;
This resulted in screen reader users finding it difficult to understand the page content structure.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
On other subscriptions (e.g. Email), if the page has component subscriptions enabled, the notification contains a link to manage the subscription (https://&lt;pageurl>/subscriptions/&lt;subscriberID>/edit) - this allows the receiver to update the components selected for that subscription method. &#xd;
&#xd;
>> this is expected as per [https://support.atlassian.com/statuspage/docs/enable-component-subscriptions/] &#xd;
&#xd;
However, this link is missing in the payload sent to Webhooks. This means a webhook subscriber is unable to easily update their subscription without knowing to copy their subscriber ID from the unsubscribe link, and use it in the above link instead. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Ensure page has "Component Subscriptions" enabled &#xd;
 # Add a webhook subscriber &#xd;
 # Create/update an incident &#xd;
 # Check the payload sent to the webhook and notice it is missing the edit subscription link that is present in email &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
For the payload sent to the webhook endpoint to also contain the "Edit Subscription" link &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Webhook payload does NOT contain the "Edit Subscription" link &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Look at the "unsubscribe" link to find the webhooks subscriber ID (this is included in the webhook payload)&#xd;
 ** It can be found here: "unsubscribe":"http://&lt;pageURL>/?unsubscribe=&lt;{+}*subscriberID*{+}>&#xd;
 # Formulate the edit subscription link which looks like this: https://{+}*&lt;pageurl>*{+}/subscriptions/{+}*&lt;subscriberID>*{+}/edit</description><createDate>2025-03-27T03:43:47.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Users with the product admin role cannot add new pages</summary><key>STATUS-859</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STATUS-859</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

As per https://support.atlassian.com/statuspage/docs/what-user-permissions-can-i-grant/ a product admin should be able to add a new page. When checking it, product admins are not able to do so, as the option is missing. &#xd;
&#xd;
Being a member of a "product-admin" group wasn't sufficient to add a new page within the org. Only after added the user to the "org-admin" group the "+" sign was visible&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When customers try to add an app developed with the Forge framework to a sandbox site(via Marketplace) that has already been added to the production site and is paid subscription, they don't see the "Add to sandbox" option. Instead, they only get the Trial version option.&#xd;
&#xd;
This only applies to Forge-based apps, Connect-based apps do get the "Add to sandbox" option and can be used for free in the sandbox as long as they are installed in the production site as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Important NOTE:* The issue is *only* with the front end, and the backend rightly recognises the app as already paid in production, thus a free *Standard Sandbox* offering is provisioned for forge apps as well. However, in the UI, we don't get the "Add to sandbox" option.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install any forge app to a production site - Ex. Planning Poker&#xd;
 # Open the sandbox site and go "Find new apps" and try to add the same app.&#xd;
 # Observe that you get only the "Free Trial" button.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

Customers should see the "Add to Sandbox" button when trying to add the app to the sandbox site.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When running JCMA preflight, sometimes the AnonPermission preflight check description on UI is blank. However on refresh it gets updated.&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens when either JCMA is disabled/uninstalled or Jira instance restarted, and checking the details of an existing plan.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image (11).png|width=374,height=205!&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
All versions post JCMA 1.12.12 are potentially impacted&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a plan in JCMA, run preflights and save plan.&#xd;
 # Disable JCMA and then enable again.&#xd;
 # Check the saved plan details and blank description will be there.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
AnonPermission should have a description message present like the other preflights.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The description is blank.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Cause:*&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens because dashboard check was added recently in AnonPermission and UI message was updated to reflect the same. This message change is also behind a FeatureFlag. When JCMA is restarted, the in memory cache gets reset. So when checking ViewDetails, JCMA relies on getting response again from preflightCheck, but since its behind an FF and FF is not set when directly checking Plan Details, the string remains empty and UI does not show anything.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Refreshing the page or preflight resets the message correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;

The field in the Board configuration 'Hide completed issues older than' is not migrated from Server to Cloud migration.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Kanban board and Configure it&#xd;
 # In Board Configuration -General, Select a value for 'Hide completed issues older than' ({*}say 4 weeks{*})&#xd;
 # Migrate the Project along with the Board&#xd;
 # Post-migration, in the cloud the field is referred to as  "Completed issues" and the value for "Choose how long completed issues stay on your board" is by default set to *"2 weeks"*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 *  The value for 'Hide completed issues older than'  should be migrated as set in the server&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 *  The value "Completed issues" is not migrated and is set to the default value of "2 weeks" in the cloud &#xd;

&#xd;
As discussed with @[vjadhav|mailto:vjadhav@atlassian.com] and [~0da2b4edb1fb] &#xd;
&#xd;
MCS team fixed the case where estimated time with attachment is turning out lower compared to estimated time without attachment which was a bug in estimation functionality. &#xd;
&#xd;
It is important to note that the estimated time is only an approximation and cannot be made 100% accurate. The actual migration involves factors that cannot be predicted in advance. As a follow-up action, we can request the team responsible for the UI to add a disclaimer indicating that the estimated times might not be entirely accurate and are intended solely as an estimate. So as to not cause any confusion to customer. </description><createDate>2024-02-13T06:21:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi [~646205eda384] ,&#xd;

Hi everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
This is Aayushi from the JCMA team. We would like to thank you for all the comments and feedback on the bug you've been experiencing with JCMA re-opening closed sprints.&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug and the various ways it occurs (as mentioned in the Description of this bug) is due to {*}Config Drift{*}. JCMA tracks and maintains a record of the entities you have migrated (e.g workflow, custom field etc.), this functionality enables it to reduce the incidence that duplicate entities are created by linking data from entities that have previously been migrated. _*You can learn more about how JCMA links your data [here|https://support.atlassian.com/migration/docs/how-the-jira-cloud-migration-assistant-links-your-data/] &amp; [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/jira-cloud-migration-assistant-duplicates-and-tracking-entities-1063170066.html]*_&#xd;
&#xd;
In this scenario with the sprint entity if there is a *difference (drift)* in the status of the Sprint we have taken the Server/Data Center status as the source of truth which results in the JCMA behaviour you're experiencing. &#xd;
&#xd;
After careful consideration of all the scenarios and uses cases we determined the best approach to solve this bug would be to develop a feature that would enable you to choose the source of truth whenever a *Config Drift* scenario is detected. &#xd;
&#xd;
While this may not be the outcome you were expecting, changing the source of truth to Cloud may also result in another bug for use cases where the Server/Data Center status would be considered the source of truth some customers.&#xd;
&#xd;
You can monitor progress of this feature via [MIG-2100|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-2100] we have carried over all your comments and votes there as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please share any additional information about your particular use case that you think would help us prioritise building this feature.&#xd;
&#xd;
Kind regards,&#xd;
Cloud Transitions Team&#xd;

h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When migrating Projects from Server to Cloud, the migration assistant can reopen past completed Sprints in some scenarios. Some well-known scenarios are:&#xd;
 * Sprint name already exists in destination Cloud site (expected as per MIG-1339)&#xd;
 * Sprint was previously migrated under a different name after Project data changed&#xd;
 * Sprint contains cross-project issues&#xd;
 * Shared Sprints found in other Boards&#xd;
 * In phased migrations, if migrator selects on every plan to migrate "All dashboards", if a gadget/ dashboard references a sprint, although the sprint belongs to a single project board, will be exported in cross project data and the server data will take prevalence over already existing cloud data;&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
These steps only account for 1 particular scenario that is very consistent (cross-project issues):&#xd;
 # On Server site, create *Project* A with *Sprint 1* and Issues&#xd;
 # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including *Project A*&#xd;
 # On Cloud site, complete *Sprint 1*&#xd;
 # On Server site, create *Project B* with Issues. Assign an Issue to *Sprint 1*&#xd;
 # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including only *Project B*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Considering *Project A* was not in the scope of the migration, this should have no impact, OR a new *Sprint 1* should be created in {*}Project B{*}.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
*Sprint 1* from *Project A* is reopened. This is also still applicable if the Sprint was renamed in the Server site where it will update the Sprint name in the Cloud site.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
If migrating in phases with the option to migrate "All dashboards" in each phase, prior to the migration, contact Atlassian Migration Support with the result of the below query:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
SELECT&#xd;
    pp.ID AS DashboardID,&#xd;
    pp.PAGENAME AS DashboardName,&#xd;
    pc.ID AS GadgetID,&#xd;
    pc.GADGET_XML AS GadgetKey,&#xd;
    gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE AS SprintID,&#xd;
    aosp."NAME" AS SprintName,&#xd;
    aosp."START_DATE" AS SprintStartDate,&#xd;
    aosp."COMPLETE_DATE" AS SprintCompleteDate,&#xd;
    aosp."END_DATE" AS SprintEndDate,&#xd;
    aosp."CLOSED" AS SprintClosed,&#xd;
    aosp."STARTED" AS SprintStarted,&#xd;
    aosp."RAPID_VIEW_ID" AS RapidViewID &#xd;
    FROM&#xd;
       PORTALPAGE pp&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       PORTLETCONFIGURATION pc ON pp.ID = pc.PORTALPAGE&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       GADGETUSERPREFERENCE gup_sprint ON pc.ID = gup_sprint.PORTLETCONFIGURATION AND gup_sprint.USERPREFKEY = 'sprintId'&#xd;
   JOIN&#xd;
       "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" aosp ON gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE = aosp."ID"::text;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Atlassian support will be able to map the above result with the existing cloud data and will provide you the differences for the potentially impacted sprints. Having this information, migrator can take educated decision on whether to proceed in using the migrate "All dashboard" option with impact or not migrating dashboards (as long as all dashboards were migrated in the first migration phase). More than this, the information provided can be leveraged to modify the on premise sprints via REST/ API or database ( by setting to the on prem sprints the values existing on cloud).</description><createDate>2024-06-10T13:20:53.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update – 19 November 2024|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#deebff}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
JCMA is not able to finish running the preflights in case it contains a filter with "WAS NOT IN" or "WAS IN", and other filters have a reference to it.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install any version of JCMA greater than 1.11.0 (could be the latest one).&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Migration Assistant home, create a migration plan including all boards and filters on it&#xd;
 # Run the preflight checks&#xd;
 # Check that cross-project boards and filters preflight check failed  !image-2024-05-14-15-09-06-531.png|width=529,height=107!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Example Data used to Reproduce the issue&#xd;
 # Create a project with key KANBAN&#xd;
 # Create 4 issues for this project&#xd;
 # Create at least 4 filters with the following configuration:&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_1: filter != KANBAN_2 AND filter != KANBAN_3 AND filter != KANBAN_4 ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_2: Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 OR Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 OR Filter = KANBAN_3 OR Filter = KANBAN_4 ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_3: project = KANBAN AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2025-12-31 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND (resolution != duplicate OR resolution is EMPTY) AND priority in (Highest, High, Medium) AND (labels not in (frictionpoint) OR labels is EMPTY) AND status was not in (Closed, Resolved) ORDER BY created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
 ** KANBAN_4: project = KANBAN AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2023-12-31 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND Status in (Backlog,Done,"In Progress",Open,Resolved) OR project = SCRUM AND (resolved >= 2022-01-01 AND resolved &lt; 2023-01-01 OR resolved is EMPTY) AND Status was in (Backlog,Done,"In Progress",Open,Resolved) AND status in (Closed) ORDER BY key ASC, created DESC, updated DESC, status DESC, Rank ASC&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The preflights should be able to run successfully on this scenario.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Not include boards and filters on the migration plan, or contact Atlassian support team for additional help.</description><createDate>2024-05-14T18:19:56.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>'Create from template' macro don't point to correct template after migration with CCMA</summary><key>MIG-1872</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1872</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When migrating Confluence spaces via CCMA or Space export/import the 'Create from template' macro don't work and display the follow message when clicked on:&#xd;
&#xd;
bq.  The template selected is not available anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create local page template in space &#xd;
 # Create new page and add 'Create from template' macro, point it to page template from previous step&#xd;
 # Migrate space from Server/DC to Cloud via CCMA or via manual space export/import&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
'Create from template' macro button works on destination and a new page is created with the desired template&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking the 'Create from template' macro button causes the following message to show:&#xd;
&#xd;
bq.  The template selected is not available anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you edit the macro it'll show pointing to the first template in the list instead of the desired template.&#xd;
&#xd;
Page source points to an old Server templateid:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:xml}&#xd;
&lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name="create-from-template" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="aaaa-bbbbb-cccccc-dddddd">&#xd;

&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="templateId">123456789&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="title">Sample title&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
&lt;ac:parameter ac:name="buttonLabel">Add template page&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Edit the macro on the page and select the desired page template that should be used and publish the change.</description><createDate>2023-12-12T18:38:11.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Custom field Customer Request Type is not migrated with JCMA and may cause JQLs to break</summary><key>MIG-1794</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1794</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Migrating from on-prem JSM, the custom field {*}Customer Request Type{*}, which is a locked field that has its custom field type as _Customer Request Type,_ deliberately gets merged with the locked custom field in Cloud, {*}Request Type{*}, which has the same custom field type _Customer Request Type._&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Create a filter that references the custom field _Customer Request Type_&#xd;
 # Create a JSM Project, add this custom field to that project via association with the project's screen&#xd;
 # Create a Jira issue on that project, and populate the _Customer Request Type_ custom field with any given value&#xd;
 # Migrate that project to an Atlassian cloud site with JCMA&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Filters have their JQL updated with the new custom field name.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Customer Request Type values gets added to the _Request Type_ custom field (seems intentional)&#xd;
 * Filters break because their JQLs reference the _Customer Request Type_ custom field (seems unintentional)&#xd;
&#xd;
The values of the {*}Customer Request Type{*}, like contexts and screens, are appended into the custom field *Request Type* in Cloud after migration.&#xd;
&#xd;
The custom field _Customer Request Type_ does not get migrated. Instead, its values are copied to the _Request Type_ custom field.&#xd;
This might cause JQL/Filters that use this custom field name to not bring the expected results.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is no automated workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;
&#xd;
Meanwhile, to fix the broken JQLs, users must edit them manually and reference the _Request Type_ custom field instead.&#xd;

This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
Migration Type: server to cloud &#xd;
&#xd;
CCMA migrates spaces with “Null” spacestatus&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Use the latest CCMA 3.9.4&#xd;
2. Create a migration plan with a space having null spacestate. This can be identified using the below query.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
select SPACEID, SPACEKEY, SPACESTATUS FROM SPACES&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
3. The Migration will run successfully without any Errors or Warnings.&#xd;
4. MAUI will show this space to be migrated successfully.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
[Navigate|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/navigate-spaces/] to view the migrated space on cloud site. This space should be listed here.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * We will be unable to see the space anywhere on the cloud UI. &#xd;
 * This is because the *spacestatus* of this space is a NULL.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
1. To fix this on the cloud site if the space is already migrated, update the *spacestatus* of the space to current by a DB update using the below query.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
update spaces set spacestatus = 'CURRENT' where spacekey = ‘&lt;SPACEKEY>’&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
2. To fix this on the Confluence server before performing the migration follow the below steps.&#xd;
 * Go to the Space with Null value spacestatus and click on Spacetools -> Overview -> Edit Space Details&#xd;
 * Select “Edit Space Details”&#xd;
 * Change the status to Current and Save it</description><createDate>2024-01-22T14:04:59.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>JCMA doesn't migrate all single project filters by default</summary><key>MIG-1642</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-1642</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Data integrity checks within the migration flow causes sprint board associations stored on table/column "AO_60DB71_SPRINT"."RAPID_VIEW_ID" to not migrate as expected. This happens because the data integrity checks can overwrite specific data that impact the sprint board association to a null value when certain conditions are met.&#xd;
&#xd;
*_Steps to Reproduce_*&#xd;
 # On data center you have 2 projects, Project A and Project B&#xd;
 # Create a board and sprint (Sprint A) that includes only Project A&#xd;
 # Put a Jira issue (PROJA-1) from Project A into Sprint A.&#xd;
 # Now change the filter for Sprint A to a filter that only includes Project B.&#xd;
 # PROJA-1 has Sprint field = Sprint A, but PROJA-1 is no longer showing in Sprint A (because the filter was changed).&#xd;
 # Now migrate Project B then Project A&#xd;
&#xd;
*_Expected Results_*&#xd;
The Sprint in "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" has a valid "RAPID_VIEW_ID".&#xd;
&#xd;
_*Actual Results*_&#xd;
The Sprint in "AO_60DB71_SPRINT" has "RAPID_VIEW_ID" as null because PROJA-1 sprints are not treated as valid because they no longer point to Project A. No errors are thrown in the logs.&#xd;
&#xd;

Also think this is strange that this is not a standard feature. For use-cases outside of the standard software world, it is very common to use Jira to model and track Business Process Flows. These tend to have multiple statuses (20+ not uncommon) and multiple transitions with conditions, validators, and non-linear directions. The current way they get migrated and visualised in could make it impossible to visualise at what stage in the process the issue is really at. It takes many hours to rearrange these (our instance has 40+ complex workflows). As another user posted this cannot be done in a migration weekend, where there are already enough other technical things that need to be done.</text><author>Paddy Byrne</author></comments><comments><text>https://getsupport.atlassian.com/browse/MOVE-130653&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In business projects: the column order set by admins is ignored and columns appear grouped by their Status category (To Do, In Progress, Done) for regular users&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a business project.&#xd;
 # With an admin user, add a few extra columns/statuses with different status categories.&#xd;
 # Shift the columns/status order in the board.&#xd;
 # Access the project board with a non-admin user.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The columns are visualized in the order the admin set them.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The column reorder is only visible to the admin that made the change. For regular users, the columns are ordered first by their status category and then by their status ID apparently. For example:  !Column order comparison.png|width=413,height=216!&#xd;
&#xd;
*Notes:*&#xd;
In addition, there is another bug that prevents regular users from changing the column order for themselves, it might be connected: [JWMCLOUD-873: Regular users are not able to re-order column in Business Board|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JWMCLOUD-873]&#xd;

&#xd;
The List view is storing column configuration in browser local storage which is why they are not persisting when you change browser or log out of Jira. As an alternative, you can use the "Issues" tab in List mode which will persist your preferences - [https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/search-for-issues-in-a-project/].</description><createDate>2024-08-07T01:58:51.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The number of people affected is actually growing in out teams, however that may be possible...</text><author>Luka Meyli Gömer</author></comments><comments><text>We are experiencing the same issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem is that the individual user's settings (filters, grouping, columns etc.) are not saved on user level. They go back to defaults after the session is restored (time has passed, logged out, private mode, using another device, using another web browser).&#xd;
&#xd;
In my opinion keeping the settings on user level is a must have functionality - same as on any internet browser (e.g. chrome, edge) - if you login on any device you'll see all your favourites etc. on any pc you use.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
DVCS Synchronization Enters Infinite Loop Due to Queued Messages for Deleted Branches&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up a Jira instance with DVCS functionality enabled, using version *10.2.0* or later. (bulk sync was added in this version).&#xd;
 # Configure a DVCS repository with multiple branches, including some that will be deleted after initial synchronization.&#xd;
 # Initiate a manual soft synchronization to queue messages for all branch heads.&#xd;
 # Delete one of the branches in the GitHub repository after the initial synchronization. It's important that the branch is deleted from the repository after the message is created, but before the message queue processes it.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 - Jira should detect the deleted branch and remove or invalidate any queued messages related to it.&#xd;
 - The synchronization process should complete successfully for all existing branches without errors.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 - Jira attempts to process the message for the deleted branch, resulting in repeated failures and retries.&#xd;
 - The synchronization process for the affected repository does not complete successfully. In the UI we can confirm this by observing that the affected repositoriy is just spinning infinitely.&#xd;
 - The logs will become spammed with very frequent 404 messages for the deleted branch.&#xd;
&#xd;

h3. Workaround 1: Force stop the affected repositories.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}Force Stop and Sync Affected Repositories{*}: Manually abort the running synchronization for the affected repositories and initiate a forced synchronization.&#xd;
 - Use a {{curl}} command or Postman to send a {{POST}} request to Jira's internal API endpoint. This request will abort any running synchronization for the specified repository.&#xd;
 - *API Endpoint:*&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
POST &lt;JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/dvcs-connector-internal/1.0/repository/{id}/abortRunningSync&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 - *Example curl Command:*&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
curl -X POST -u your-username\:your-api-token \&#xd;
'&lt;JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/dvcs-connector-internal/1.0/repository/{id}/abortRunningSync'&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
This will abort the runing sync for the affected repository. Do note that this is a hard stop. Data that was queued to be processed is also dropped. On next soft sync the data should be queued again and synced properly.&#xd;
h3. Workaround 2: Revert to Previous Sync Mechanism&#xd;
&#xd;
The bulk commit sync feature in Jira 10.2.0 has a dark feature flag {{dvcs.connector.github.bulk.commit.soft.sync.disabled}} that can be toggled to revert to the previous, slower sync mechanism. This can help avoid the infinite loop issue caused by messages for deleted branches.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps:*&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Access dark feature management using the [Atlassian guide]([https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-manage-dark-features-in-jira-server-and-data-center-959286331.html]).&#xd;
2. Add dark feature {{dvcs.connector.github.bulk.commit.soft.sync.disabled}}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When an issue has a Parent Link and its issue type is changed to a type on another hierarchy level, the Parent Link data remains. Consequently, the Parent Link is still visible on the issue view with a warning icon that suggests the Parent Link violates the current Hierarchy configuration and should be updated by the user.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is worsened when an Epic Link is also present on the Issue that had the Issue Type changed. The presence of an Epic Link makes Jira automatically hide the Parent Link from the Screens and makes it harder to remove the leftover data.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue can lead to unexpected and unusual behaviour in Jira. For instance, JQL queries may produce results that differ from what is anticipated. For example, 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over the Issue hierarchy ({*}linkedIssuesOfRecursive{*}) and can return a different set of issues than Jira functions like({*}childIssuesOf{*}).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 1*&#xd;
 # Create a new issue type called 'Initiative'&#xd;
 # Configure the hierarchy to be above Epic (at the top level)&#xd;
 # Create a new issue with the issue type 'Initiative'&#xd;
 # Link an Epic to the new Initiative using the parent link&#xd;
 # Open the Epic and use More > Move to change the issue type to 'Initiative'&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 2 (inconsistent results returned from childIssuesOf(...) query)*&#xd;
 # Create a new project.&#xd;
 # Configure the hierarchy like this:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
- EpicBusiness&#xd;
-- Capability&#xd;
--- Epic&#xd;
----Story &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
A) The experienced Issue follows the below scenario ...&#xd;
 - The Capability CAP-100 has the EpicBusiness EPB-100 as Parent.&#xd;
 - The Epic EP-100 has CAP-100 as Parent&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)&#xd;
returns CAP-100 and all its child : Epic (EP-100), User Story (...), Sub-Task (...)&#xd;
&#xd;
B) A user move CAP-100 as an EpicBusiness : EPB-110&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-110)&#xd;
returns always same children as when it was CAP-100&#xd;
 - The Epic EP-100 has EPB-110 as direct Parent, an EpicBusiness ! Normally, only Capabilities should be allowed as Parent of Epic&#xd;
 - The JQL&#xd;
issue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)&#xd;
returns always same children, including EPB-110 (ex-CAP-100) ! Normally, an EpicBusiness can not have a EpicBusiness as Parent.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is causing many inconsistencies in the users activities&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 3 (involved 3rd party plugin)*&#xd;
&#xd;
*1.* Install a 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over Issue hierarchy&#xd;
&#xd;
*2.* Create Issue Types "Initiative" and "Capability" and add them to a Project's Scheme&#xd;
&#xd;
*3.* Add the Parent Link Custom Field to all Screens on that Project (to make it easier to follow the steps)&#xd;
&#xd;
*4.* Configure the Roadmaps Hierarchy so that Initiative > Capability > Epic&#xd;
&#xd;
*5.* Create a set of Issues organized as such:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
Initiative 1&#xd;
  Capability 1&#xd;
    Epic 1&#xd;
	  Story 1&#xd;
  Capability 2&#xd;
    Epic 2&#xd;
	  Story 2&#xd;
&#xd;
Epic 3&#xd;
  Story 3&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
*6.* Create a Filter using the 3rd party app JQL function to list the Hierarchy of the top Issue, like:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
issue = "&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>" OR issueFunction in linkedIssuesOfRecursive("&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>", "is parent of")&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
*7.* Confirm all Issues under the hierarchy of "Initiative 1" are listed&#xd;
&#xd;
*8.* Change the Issue Type of "Capability 2" to Story (Move operation also works) and set it's Epic Link to "Epic 3"&#xd;
&#xd;
*9.* Reload the Filter and see "Capability 2" (now a Story) is still being listed, though it's now in the Hierarchy of "Epic 3", not under "Initiative 1"&#xd;
&#xd;
If you use Jira's native JQL functions, the Epic Link has precedence over the (invalid) Parent Link and "Capability 2" is not listed anymore:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
issue = "&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>" OR issue in childIssuesOf("&lt;Initiative 1 Issue Key>")&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
- The parent link will be cleared as you should be able to only link an issue to a parent issue of the _corresponding hierarchy level_ that you've configured for your plan.&#xd;
- A Move Issue with change of Type (in Roadmap Hierarchy) must break all Parent Links or be blocked while a Parent-Child link exists&#xd;
- A Move Issue between JSW Issue Types and JPO Issue Types should be follow same rule&#xd;
- The JQL childIssueOf() should return children in respect of Hierarchies. Parent Link between Issue Type in same Level hierarchy should be ignored.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * The parent link data remains and the warning below can be seen next to this field:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
This link is inconsistent with your Portfolio hierarchy.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 * The parent link can't be edited as there is still Epic Link&#xd;
 * The "Capability" Issue has a valid Epic Link which is prioritized by Jira and an invalid Parent Link which is ignored.&#xd;
 * The data is still left over in both DB tables:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
issuelink&#xd;
entity_property {code}&#xd;
* The JQL childIssueOf() return the same results after move the ticket to another parent hierarchy issue type.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h4. 1. Create an automation to remove the Parent Link&#xd;
&#xd;
Create an automation rule that will automatically clear the *Parent Link* field whenever an issue is moved to a new issue type, as explained in the KB article linked below:&#xd;
 * [Automation For Jira - How to clear the Parent Link field when an issue is moved to a new type|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1206795140]&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. 2. Remove Parent Link manually&#xd;
&#xd;
To remove the parent link: &#xd;
 * Convert the issue back to its previous issue type(e.g. Epic).&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Remove the parent link. &#xd;
&#xd;
 * Convert back to the new issue type.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. 3. Remove existing data directly from the database&#xd;
&#xd;
To clean up existing Issues' Parent Links refer to this documentation:&#xd;
 * [Searching for child or parent Issues using JQL functions report wrong results in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1282250410]</description><createDate>2017-11-28T07:03:18.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We encountered this issue as well.

&#xd;
Just created a hierarchy above Initiative and saved changes. (Didn't bother to associate isssue types or change anything else)&#xd;
&#xd;
Went to the Initiative and cleared the Parent Link field. Reverted the changes back to original state in portfolio hierarchy.&#xd;
&#xd;
Worked like a charm :)</text><author>Gowri Kumar</author></comments><comments><text>In my situation I fixed by:&#xd;
 # removing the Epic Link from the Story - which revealed the Parent Link (with the warning icon)&#xd;
 # removing Parent Link&#xd;
 # re-assigning Epic Link&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
BTW, this can't be done via Bulk Edit since, for some reason, the Issue Search and Bulk Edit recognize the fact that the Parent Link is invalid and, therefore, don't show it in search results or allow it to be set to Empty in a Bulk Edit.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Preventative medicine... make sure Epics and Stories use different screen schemes (even better, remove issue type from the screens).  That way users won't be able to turn an Epic into a Story, which is what made this issue manifest in our system.&#xd;
&#xd;
Definitely +1ing this one.&#xd;

&#xd;
Neither the issue view, issue edit nor bulk edit screens will allow me to clear the field.&#xd;
&#xd;
However the fix from Mihai Schwarz is quick and works.  You don't even need to assign an issue type to the dummy entry you create.</text><author>Richard Cross</author></comments><comments><text>*Workaround*&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If a user edits an issue (either with the edit button or bulk update) to update the issue type of an issue, Roadmap does not automatically disassociate the issue from existing parent issue even if it does not match the Roadmap hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create a hierarchy such as : L1 (Level 1 issue), L2 (Level 2 issue), L3 (Epic),...&#xd;
# Create an issue with Level 1 issue type.&#xd;
# Create 2 issues with Level 2 issue type.&#xd;
# Create 2 issues with Epic issue type.&#xd;
# Access the Roadmap plan which shows the issues.&#xd;
# Move the newly created Level 2 issues as child issue of Level 1 issue.&#xd;
# Move each of newly created Epic issues as child issue of Level 2 issues.&#xd;
# Review and publish the changes from plan.&#xd;
# Open one of the Level 2 issue in an issue view.&#xd;
# Edit the issue type of the Level 2 issue to Level 1 issue.&#xd;
# Access the plan again and we will see the Level 1 issue has an Epic issue as child issue which does not follow the Roadmap hierarchy.&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen recording: [^JPO-4277.webm] &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
* Roadmap automatically disassociate the child issue of the parent issue if the configuration is against the Roadmap's hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
* Child issue remains to be associated with the parent issue even though it's against the Roadmap's hierarchy configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user filter has more than 50+ sprint names selected in the advanced JQL query, it will cause the query to be running slowly. For example:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
project in (TEST) AND sprint in (Sprint-A, Sprint-B, Sprint-C, Sprint-D and so on....)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The searching does not impact admin users.&#xd;

h3. Current Design&#xd;
&#xd;
Every time user asks for sprint we're checking if the user has access to it and it has if the user:&#xd;
* is an admin,&#xd;
* OR has access to the board&#xd;
* OR has access to any issue from this sprint.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Suggestions&#xd;
&#xd;
To fix that problem by creating a feature flag or cache the results to improve the performance in the future.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To speed up the searching process, we recommend a workaround by replacing sprint names with sprint IDs.&#xd;
&#xd;
To find the Sprint ID, please paste the sprint names and run the SQL query:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
SELECT ID, NAME FROM AO_60DB71_SPRINT WHERE NAME like '%SPRINT_NAME%';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) Replace *SPRINT_NAME* with the sprint name from the filter.&#xd;
&#xd;
Or you can find the sprint id following the [Jira Software: How to identify the ID of a sprint|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-software-how-to-identify-the-id-of-a-sprint-779159065.html] KB article.&#xd;
&#xd;
Update all the sprint names to id from the filter and then saved the filter.&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
DVCS data related to the issue should load in the Dev Panel.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Data is not loaded into the dev panel which should return either the cached existing data or the new one stored into DB after soft or hard sync.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Kanban backlog board is being used in a gadget on a dashboard, a Kanplan acknowledge section is being rendered on top of it with the following text:&#xd;
&#xd;
{quote}A bigger and better backlog has just landed&#xd;
We've created a dedicated space for you to plan in the new Kanban backlog. This board will now be a distraction-free zone for your team to focus on work-in-progress.{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
That acknowledgment has links like "Take me there", "Close", etc, and none of them are working when viewed on the dashboard. The same links work fine when the acknowledgement is viewed in the board view.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a Kanban project&#xd;
# Create a Kanban board&#xd;
# Enable Kanban feature by dragging unmapped status to the leftmost column in "Columns" configuration of the board&#xd;
# Use this board in a dashboard gadget&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Users are able to dismiss the alert when rendered on a dashboard.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Clicking on any links in the alert do nothing. Nothing is logged in the Javascript console either.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
It is possible to disable the banner altogether by modifying {{$JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/application-installation/jira-software-installation/jira-greenhopper-plugin-xxxx.jar/atlassian-plugin.xml}} and commenting out all sections referencing KanplanAcknowledge resources:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:xml}&lt;!--&lt;resource type="download" name="KanPlanAcknowledge.js" location="includes/js/rapid/ui/kanplan/KanPlanAcknowledge.js"/>-->&#xd;
&lt;!--&lt;resource type="download" name="KanPlanAcknowledge.soy.js" location="includes/js/rapid/ui/kanplan/KanPlanAcknowledge.soy"/>-->{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Save the modified file in a JAR file, and restart Jira for change to take effect.</description><createDate>2018-11-19T11:36:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>As an adminitrator of a Jira Software Server instance, the workaround worked on my Jira v7.13.0 installation.</text><author>Valsaa</author></comments><comments><text>In 7.6.16 the board will only display an error:&#xd;

&#xd;
Just wondering: As customers pay for Atlassian support, they should be able to expect a fix for such a bug (honestly, it should be found in Atlassians own tests before the software gets released) at least in the next long term release. Instead, after more than a year Atlassian is still gathering impact. What do you charge for support when so many issues do not get fixed? Most customers are more interested in reliable software than in new features.</text><author>Antje Stejskal</author></comments><comments><text>This is so crucial and basic.

Summary&#xd;
 It appears Jira Software loses viability on an issue's change history when a previously existing status is removed ( changed ) from the project's workflow. This affects the historical reporting on the various agile charts for the affected project.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Configure a workflow with the following statuses&#xd;
 ## Open -> In Progress -> Resolved -> Closed&#xd;
 # Create a sprint, add an issue from the backlog, transition every step from Open until Closed, and complete the sprint&#xd;
 # Create new workflow with the following statuses&#xd;
 ## Open -> In Progress -> Status 9&#xd;
 # Migrate workflow, map issues in Resolved and Closed to Status 9&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Agile reports are unaffected by this change&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint report show issues moved from Resolved and Closed to Status 9 as being In Progress and Removed From Sprint. Cycle Time is also incorrectly calculated for these issues as well. See attached screenshots.&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue history:&#xd;
 !issue-history.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint report:&#xd;
 !sprint-report-bad.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Notice how the Sprint report shows issue 1 as Open instead of Status 9&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
Other Agile reports may be affected from this change.&#xd;
 While the original report comes from Jira 6.4 / Jira Agile 6.7 we reproduced this problem in Jira 7.11 too.&#xd;
&#xd;
This can affect any status on the far right or far left for example if you leave out a to do status from the old workflow, the sprint report will not see that the issues were ever "started" and it will negatively affect burndown&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Modify the affect project's workflow, add changed status back, and map this status to a column in the project's agile board(respective to their position in the old board i.e. far right or far left) They do not need transitions to or from other statuses. In the example above Agile reporting is fixed by adding Resolved and Closed back to the affected project's workflow and mapping the statuses to the Done column accordingly. See attached screenshot.&#xd;

- Data can not be compared anymore to previous sprints;&#xd;
- All in all, the report information now feels 'inrealiable" to our users.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm really surprised, that this major error is still "gathering impact" and prioritized as Low. As our Jira users grow rapidly (>5000), we are continuously optimising our configuration. And we should be able to make changes - like this status change - without losing information along the way, and without users losing confidence in the tool.&#xd;

&#xd;
I think you should read this great article I found on the web: [https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-metrics]&#xd;
&#xd;
It says:&#xd;
{quote}*Summary:* _Scrum metrics are specific data points that scrum teams track and use to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Scrum teams use metrics to inform decision-making and become more efficient in planning and execution, as well as set target goals and improvement plans._&#xd;
&#xd;
“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it,” noted famous management thinker Peter Drucker. While this isn’t a statement that applies to every facet of life, it does apply to teams practicing agile scrum. By using certain metrics, scrum teams can adjust, pivot, and refine team effectiveness.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Looks like your teams don't really understand the importance of having reliable data with which to measure, track, and improve. It's possibly one the most important aspects of agile methodologies, in my (and your) opinion.

Dear Customers,&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you for taking the time to file and comment on this issue. We realize it still occurs and impacts your organization. We are now working on multiple customer requests and on new features, so we have to postpone our resolution of this issue. We’ve decided to move this issue to our long-term backlog.&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround for this bug is as follows:&#xd;
Modify the affected project's workflow, add the changed status back with no transitions, and map this status to a column in the project's agile board (respective to their position in the old board i.e. far right or far left)&#xd;
&#xd;
Please continue watching this ticket for future updates and changes in the timeline that impacts your work.&#xd;

Our testing to put the status back (and bulk migrate issues back to that old status) did not resolve the problem - and we're not happy to apply this workaround en-mass unless it works for our testing.&#xd;
&#xd;
Any other things to try?&#xd;
&#xd;
Can devs tell us what the fields that the reporting is reading off - for sure they are fields we can't see with frontend - but people might be able to fix data in the database directly - if there's documentation on how the reporting functions work.</text><author>Eric Lee</author></comments><comments><text>Found a quick and easy fix for this- at least in the server version.  Since the reports are based off the columns in the board instead of the issue statuses themselves (take a look at the cumulative report- you see column headings- not statuses) simply delete and re-create your columns.  &#xd;
&#xd;
We were standardizing projects where some had the final status of "Done" and others "Closed". We wanted them all as "Closed", so created standard schemes and moved all projects to those schemes.  Where Done was changed to Closed, we lost all of our completed issues in our reports.&#xd;
&#xd;
Went into the board settings and deleted the column for "done", and replaced it with a new column "closed".  Viola!  All of our completed issues magically re-appeared!</text><author>Michael Ballenger</author></comments><comments><text>Why has this Jira product defect has not been fixed yet?

Summary&#xd;
If completing a sprint takes longer than 60 seconds one will experience a timeout message similar to the following:&#xd;
 !release_timeout.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Bulk editing large amount of issues ( 200+ ) takes longer than 60 seconds&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# To reproduce artificially, lower the [AJAX timeout |https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-change-the-default-ajax-timeout-in-jira-server-824345485.html]to something like 10 seconds and do a sprint release on 3,000 issues&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
A more descriptive error message is displayed like the one we implemented for Kanban boards, https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-11775&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
A generic timeout error is displayed&#xd;

&#xd;
Although this bug seems minor and not really important I would like to emphasize how much it affects our users. We're using Jira as our main ALM tool. About 400 users are planning their work quarterly. Each issue is estimated original to some amount of time. Then assigned to a sprint. If estimation is higher then sprint capacity it's splitted into smaller chunks and estimations are updated accordingly. Users find themselves browsing  and searching for the original issues and correcting the original estimation manually. This makes them feel annoyed and confused. Also, a lot of times, they just forget to update the estimation and this, of course, is shown later in the sprint report. &#xd;
&#xd;
Please find a way to fix this bug, or find a better workaround for it (maybe using a script via script runner add on?..)&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;

Aeven if they were fixing this, you still have your admin to upgrade your version installed on your server. &#xd;

It's not fixed on the Cloud version, but a safe bet is to move to the cloud if you want to have this fixed.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint End date disregards date picker advanced setting when duration is not custom&#xd;
h4. Steps to reproduce the problem&#xd;
 # Configure advanced configuration datepicker as follow:&#xd;
 ** {{jira.date.time.picker.java.format : dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm}}&#xd;
 ** {{jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format : %d.%m.%y %I:%M}}&#xd;
 # Create a sprint > allocate issues&#xd;
 # Start sprint > choose duration of 1 week (any option other than custom)&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Date picker will show the date following the advanced configuration&#xd;
h4. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Date picker does not follow the date picker format&#xd;
 !notcustom.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
This problem does not happen if user choose custom duration as default:&#xd;
 !custom.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) If the user chooses non-custom duration initially, and then switch back to custom, the end date will still show the wrong format of the year.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h4. Workaround&#xd;
 # Select "Custom" duration.&#xd;
 # In some cases, user will have to remove the AM or PM in the Start/End date.</description><createDate>2017-04-14T12:44:45.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>When I switch to custom, the year still doesn't change to 2017 (still 17). Even when using the datepicker, it returns 17.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2017-04-14-16-24-48-363.png!&#xd;
&#xd;
Interestingly, I cannot start the sprint, neither in custom nor in week duration setting.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2017-04-14-16-32-16-743.png!&#xd;
&#xd;
As we were able to start sprints during some days, I suspect there is an issue with JIRA mixing up month and day. Having erroneous dates in the database (negative values) is a major issue as these need to be manually corrected (and we don't know how yet).&#xd;
&#xd;
Please escalate, this renders the sprint functionality completely broken. Thank you!&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>FrankTrautwein</author></comments><comments><text>Workaround is to create the sprint using the custom option and set it for 11 days so the end date is on a Saturday and only uses 10 working days. &#xd;

h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
This is not impacting any functionality. Just on logging&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. *Workaround*&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira Administrators can hide logging on the package by increasing logging level to ERROR.&#xd;
&#xd;
You can achieve this by adding these lines into *log4j.properties*:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
log4j.logger.com.atlassian.ozymandias  = ERROR, console, filelog&#xd;
log4j.additivity.com.atlassian.ozymandias = false&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
For changes to make an effect, Jira restart is required.&#xd;
&#xd;
The file log4j.properties is located at JIRA_INSTALL_DIR/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes (as of Jira 7.12.x)&#xd;
&#xd;
(on) Mind, this would make the log lines disappear, yet would not address the root cause.&#xd;
 The actual case had to be addressed by the plug-in vendor.</description><createDate>2016-12-08T08:19:04.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Occurs in  7.3.0 as well</text><author>Tom Moore</author></comments><comments><text>Occurs in 7.3.1 too.</text><author>plonnroth</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.1</text><author>AndreH</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.6</text><author>Robb Breckenridge</author></comments><comments><text>+1 JIRA 7.3.4</text><author>Suhas P</author></comments><comments><text>+ JIRA 7.3.6</text><author>Yevgen Lasman</author></comments><comments><text>+7.3.3</text><author>Stefan Bittner</author></comments><comments><text>+7.4.1</text><author>John Rebelos</author></comments><comments><text>+7.3.7</text><author>Christian Pascher</author></comments><comments><text>+7.4.2 (lots of logging) may wish to hide it using log4j.properties file modification...</text><author>Craig Solinski</author></comments><comments><text>+7.5.0 is also affected.

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When searching for the issues in a particular Sprint (eg Sprint 1) using the Sprint name in the JQL (eg Sprint = "Sprint 1"), it will display other issues in other sprints that start with 1 (Sprint 10, Sprint 11, Sprint 12 etc)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a few Sprints up to 10 or more, so that the Sprint name will be 10 or more.&#xd;
# Go to the Issue Navigator.&#xd;
# Search using the JQL (replace project name and sprint name accordingly with your own.) {code}project = "project name" AND Sprint = "sprint name 1"{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The Issue navigator will ONLY return issues that are in "sprint name 1".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The Issue navigator will also return issues that are in "sprint name 10", "sprint name 11", "sprint name 12" and so on.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
Search for the issues using the Sprint ID instead of the Sprint Name for more accurate results. &#xd;
&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
When changing configuration related to the calendars at *JIRA Administration > System*, some changes doesn't take place within JIRA Agile. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
JIRA Cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
Change calendar configuration format as per [Customizing the Look and Feel|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Customizing+the+Look+and+Feel], in the section Date/Time format:&#xd;
# Go to *JIRA Administration > System > Look and Feel*&#xd;
# Set Date/Time format to 24 hours yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm  &#xd;
# Check the box at the bottom to make Monday first day of the week, as per [How to set Monday as First Day of Week|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/How+to+Set+Monday+as+First+Day+of+Week+in+Date+Picker+Calendar]&#xd;
# Go to *JIRA Administration > System > General Configuration > Advanced Settings* and enter the format (_sysadmin_ only):&#xd;
- jira.date.time.picker.java.format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm&#xd;
- jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Calendars will be showing Monday as first day of the week, and time will be displayed in 24 hours format&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Calendars within JIRA Agile are still showing Sunday as first day of the week and am/pm format (see screenshots). The way date is displayed will change, but time seems to have no effect. In JIRA all changes have taken place correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
There's no workaround at the moment.</description><createDate>2015-07-28T10:44:24.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>*Please implement this soon*.

&#xd;
# Create an issue and add it to a future Sprint.&#xd;
# Notice that it shows up on the backlog view of the Rapid board&#xd;
# Now close that issue&#xd;
# Notice that it disappears from the backlog view&#xd;
# Now start the Sprint&#xd;
# Notice that the issue suddenly appears in the Sprint as a closed issue&#xd;

 The JIRA Agile column configuration screen does not properly identify the statuses which belong to the board when the conditions below are met:&#xd;
 # There is an issue type using a custom workflow, with different statuses, AND&#xd;
 # The JQL filter used by the Board references the issue type above, OR&#xd;
 ** e.g. Using the filter {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P}} will cause this problem, even though it should return the same results as the filter '_project = P_'.&#xd;
 # The JQL filter used by the board reference to text&#xd;
 ** e.g Using the filter {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext"}}&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem happens when the project/board is configured in such a way that it has multiple workflows (for different issue types). The board seems to only consider the statuses from the first workflow listed under its workflow scheme. The other statuses from the rest of workflow in the same workflow scheme will have a warning triangle indicating that the board doesn't recognize them.&#xd;
&#xd;
Moving any of the status with the warning triangle to the 'Unmapped statuses' column will make them disappear from the column configuration screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to Reproduce:*&#xd;
 # Restore the attached XML backup ([^column_issue.zip]).&#xd;
 # Navigate to Agile > Sample Scrum Project A.&#xd;
 # Go to Board > Configure.&#xd;
 # Go to Columns - All statuses are displayed and properly mapped to columns.&#xd;
 # Go to General and change the 'Working Filter SSPA' to the 'Broken Filter SSPA'.&#xd;
 # Refresh the Board configuration page for the new filter to be applied.&#xd;
 # Click on Columns again - The status which do not belong to the workflow used by the issue type "Test Issue Type" will have a warning triangle with the message below:&#xd;
 "This status is not available in any of the workflows used by this board. To remove, drag it to unmapped statuses where it will no longer be available."&#xd;
 # Dragging any of those statuses to the *Unmapped Statuses* column will make the status disappear from the column configuration screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround*&#xd;
 Using the sample filter above&#xd;
 * {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P}} and changing it to {{project = P AND issuetype = custom_type OR project = P and issuetype in (standardIssueTypes(),subTaskIssueTypes())}}, which yields the same results seems to resolve the problem.&#xd;
 * {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext"}} is to be changed to {{project = P AND text ~ "testtext" AND issuetype in (standardIssueTypes(),subTaskIssueTypes())}}</description><createDate>2014-12-26T17:32:15.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Could the filter be changed to just 'project = P'? This should resolve the problem as well.</text><author>David Tang</author></comments><comments><text>We experience a similar issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
When we added the following to our Scrum Board filter:&#xd;
OR issuetype in (Enhancement, Defect, "Related Defect") &#xd;
&#xd;
all statuses not pertaining pertaining to Enhancement, Defect or "Related Defect" issue types were not available for mapping to board columns. Note that it was an "OR"  condition, and other issue types were returned from the filter. In our case, we had a "Task" issue type with a status of "In Progress" that was not available for mapping once we put in that clause. &#xd;
&#xd;
To work around this, we temporarily removed that clause from the filter, mapped the "In Progress" status into a Scrum board column, and then added the clause back in. The Scrum configuration is giving us a warning that the "In Progress" status is not used by any workflow (even though it also notes there are 12 issues in that status), but the status mapping is persisting and working. </text><author>Robert Ramirez</author></comments><comments><text>We're seeing exactly what Robert R. is seeing. The workaround he describes in the last paragraph worked for us and we see the same warning (even though it shows there are x amount of issues in that status).</text><author>Shaunt Kojabashian</author></comments><comments><text>I raised the same issue GHS-23202 and we found a work around using the sub filter.</text><author>Jamie Cole</author></comments><comments><text>Good point Jamie - to be clear this was on a scrum board for us (so no sub-filter).</text><author>Brian Keefe</author></comments><comments><text>This is happening to us as well. We use a custom field to define different scrum teams that work within the same Jira project. So our filter is "project = P and 'team name'= XYZ OR project = P and issuetype = Epic". Since multiple teams can work on one Epic, we don't want to restrict Epics to one team, and Epics have a simpler workflow than the stories, so the available mapped statuses only showed the Epic statuses&#xd;
It seems that the board is filtering the statuses to the least common denominator of specified issue types (even in an OR statement)&#xd;
The workaround did work for a temporary fix, but I do think that this should be higher than minor</text><author>Courtney Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>-</text><author>Courtney Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>We face the same problem.

Our queries referenced the project. In our case, we have a project with issue types that are tied to one of four workflows. Two workflows have custom statuses.

The Sprint Report recognizes the issues but shows them as Issues Removed From Sprint. &#xd;
&#xd;
Based on the comments above, I edited the queries to specify each issue type in the project. The custom statuses now appear as unmapped statuses and can be associated with columns on the board. The issues now appear in all three modes.&#xd;

 </text><author>Chris Mitchell</author></comments><comments><text>The same problem occurred recently in one project that had only two workflows (one of them was the {color:#205081}_The default JIRA workflow_{color} which is read-only). An issue was set to status {{Reopened}} from {{Closed}} but did not appear in the Agile board of the project. The JQL of the filter was &#xd;
 {{project = &lt;projectkey> ORDER BY Rank ASC}}&#xd;
&#xd;
In the respective board configuration one could not see the status Reopened to be chosen for any column. The solution was - as mentioned above - to add the issue types.&#xd;

Is this a caching issue? I do not think that this an issue on behalf of the index because re-indexing did not help as well.&#xd;

&#xd;
I don't know if I have the same problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
The project using custom and standard issue types, custom workflow and custom statuses.&#xd;
&#xd;
The JQL is the following: &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Project in ("P") AND labels in (L) AND status not in (Closed, Resolved) OR key in (P-6577, P-6593) ORDER BY Rank ASC&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
For this, I got 13 JQL, some of are in the status: _Tested_. This status not appearing at the Kanban column mapping page.&#xd;
&#xd;
Just to review the issue, I create the same JQL (saved to another name), with a different kanban board and the _possible mapping statuses are different_ - but there is no _Tested_ again. &#xd;
&#xd;
Reindex, restart, did not help.&#xd;
&#xd;
Should I create a support ticket for you to investigate this, or it may be the same issue?&#xd;

Best: Peter</text><author>Peter Cselotei - Lupus Consulting Zrt.</author></comments><comments><text>I don't see this issue having to do with filters. For me it seems to be workflow scheme related.&#xd;
&#xd;
In some cases, it seems that when you have a workflow scheme with a workflow assigned to one issue type and one to "all unassigned", the default workflow is not being picked up by the agile boards. The workaround is to go to the workflow scheme and instead of using "all unassigned", specifically assign all other issue types to that worfklow. Actually assigning even one issue type will cause the workflow to be picked up.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm not entirely sure why this happens as it doesn't seem to happen every time but it's definitely the boards not picking up the workflow for "all unassigned issue types".</text><author>Evangelos Vrocharis</author></comments><comments><text>We have noted this in JIRA Software 7.1.6.

&#xd;
Is there any timeline on when this issue will be addressed?</text><author>Raj Vora</author></comments><comments><text>Issue seems to occur in Jira Server 8.0.2 as well</text><author>Maciej Tkaczyk</author></comments><comments><text>I think I ran into this failure mode as well.&#xd;
* I had a project without a workflow scheme, which seems to map all issue-type names to the default&#xd;
* I created a workflow scheme and mapped a single issue-type name to a custom workflow&#xd;
&#xd;
Then the board refused to acknowledge the existence of the new status in the custom workflow&#xd;
* the new status does not show up as unmapped on the board=>columns settings&#xd;
* if I transition an issue to the new status, it simply disappears from the board (because it is not mapped, and apparently not mappable)&#xd;
&#xd;
I tried modifying the board filter to include another project, which then enabled the capture of some new status, but only from the new project.&#xd;
I deleted the project I care about, saved; then added back, saved.  Still no cigar&#xd;
Next will attempt some of the suggestions from earlier commentators' (modifying the filter to explicitly capture status details)&#xd;
&#xd;
...&#xd;
h3. Solved&#xd;
I managed to solve this by a seemingly trivial modification of the filter.&#xd;
* was: this AND that OR other AND another&#xd;
* changed to explicitly group: (this AND that) OR (other AND another) &#xd;
&#xd;
That did the trick - picked up all the previously-unmapped status in every workflow, and I was able to map the new one that I cared about using.  Also note: jira still sees these explicit groupings as redundant, and ultimately deletes the parentheses in the saved filter query.  i.e., there is no actual evidence remaining after you save the new and explicitly-grouped filter query.  Next time you view it, the explicit grouping is omitted.  But the act of having done it seems to tickle the failure-mechanism in a way that provides for an effective work-around.  It hints that the underlying root-cause is a bug with the JQL parser.</text><author>Mark Caruso</author></comments><comments><text>I found that if there are issues with 2 different workflows involved but they share a common status, that the board will "decide" which issue workflow to map the status to and only allow to drag/drop transition an that issue and not others. &#xd;
&#xd;
For example: my filter finds Stories and Sub-Tasks. The workflow is different for the 2 issue types, but both have a status of "In Progress". I found that "In Progress" works for Sub-Tasks and I can drag them from 'New' to 'In Progress'. But I can't drag the Story from 'Backlog' to 'In Progress' - I have to edit the story and transition it and then it shows up on the board 'In Progress'&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Keith Lanier</author></comments><comments><text>Solution by Mark - changed to explicitly group: (this AND that) OR (other AND another) solved the problem for us. But the user had 80 filters in 80 boards and he has to change all of them.&#xd;
&#xd;
When will the fix be out? Its still there in Jira 8.5.</text><author>Divya TV</author></comments><comments><text>Your suggested work around did not work, but making my query super simple, saving it, and then editing again to re-complexify it worked like a charm.</text><author>Tomi Bates</author></comments><comments><text>I also ran into this issue. At least I think I did. My project contains the issuetypes Improvement, Task and Sub-Task. The kanban board filter query used to be project = p ORDER by rank which resulted in no status being shown in the board configuration at all. Chaging it to project = p AND issuetypes in (standardIssueTypes(), subTaskIssueTypes()) worked. &#xd;
&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When attempting to create a new board or update a saved filter in the existing board, the user may be unable to retrieve the shared filter depending upon where it is returned in the search results.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create the following saved filters:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Cash Management - A&#xd;
Cash Management - B&#xd;
Cash Management - C&#xd;
Cash Management - D&#xd;
Cash Management - E&#xd;
Cash Management - F&#xd;
Cash Management - G&#xd;
Cash Management - H&#xd;
Cash Management - I&#xd;
Cash Management - J&#xd;
Cash Management - K&#xd;
Cash Management - L&#xd;
Cash Management - M&#xd;
Cash Management - N&#xd;
Cash Management - O&#xd;
Cash Management - P&#xd;
Cash Management - Q&#xd;
Cash Management - R&#xd;
Cash Management - S&#xd;
Cash Management - T&#xd;
Cash Management - U&#xd;
Cash Management - V&#xd;
Cash Management - W&#xd;
Cash Management - X&#xd;
Cash Management - Y&#xd;
Cash Management - Z&#xd;
Man ABC&#xd;
Man Man&#xd;
Man_Man&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
# Create a new JIRA Agile board from an existing Saved Filter.&#xd;
# Attempt to enter "Man Man" or "Man_Man".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filters are returned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filters are not returned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
It appears that there is a limitation in the number of results that the drop-down can return, and if the filter is returned after those results it does not appear. If all the 'Cash Management' filters do not exist, 'Man_Man' and 'Man Man' will appear.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Rename the filter something else temporarily, such as A Man ABC, and then use that as it will appear at the top of the list.</description><createDate>2014-10-31T14:42:27.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Our Agile board already upgraded to version 6.6.13 and it wasn't resolve the issue.</text><author>Treethawat Thanawachiramate</author></comments><comments><text>We are also impacted by this issue.

Thanks,</text><author>Nguyễn Hải Vân</author></comments><comments><text>Dear all,&#xd;
&#xd;
Just change the filter name to a unique one and create Board then change the name again :). &#xd;
&#xd;
Like: I can't search for saved filter named AAAA_TASK_DONE then i change its name to U1NY ==> Create board with U1NY, then rename U1NY to AAAA_TASK_DONE.&#xd;
&#xd;
I do know this problem will occur again and again and we all do not know when will this problem be solved so just consider above solution as a workaround way&#xd;

It looks like the bug is triggered by using special characters in the title of your jql filter.

&#xd;
It seems if you also create around 20 Agile Boards all beginning with the same string, and including special characters like hyphen or underscore, a similar bug manifests in that the drop-down doesn't list some of the Agile Boards at all (the list gets truncated somehow).&#xd;
&#xd;
Ex: Create agile boards ABC_one, ABC_two, ABC_three, ABC_four, etc. and the Issue Source drop-down (in Portfolio) stops listing any boards after ABC_twenty.</text><author>Jeffrey Thornsen</author></comments><comments><text>Yes, I also got same issue.

&#xd;
Had to remove the special character - from the filter name to workaround this issue.</text><author>Missy Ann Mathews</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Atlassian Team,&#xd;
&#xd;
We faced the same issue using Jira Server 8.13.0.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our Jira users use many filters, and therefore decided to name them using special patterns. For example,&#xd;
{quote}tsspe.ph3.ssp.planning.long.all_tasks&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
, where _tsspe.ph3.ssp_ is a filter prefix. And there are many filter starting from this prefix (let it be 50).&#xd;
&#xd;
And filter from example above is not appearing while creating or editing Kanban/Scrum Board. Copy-pasting full filter name, trying to populate it char by char do not help.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although, it is still available while creating/editing gadgets.&#xd;
&#xd;
As mentioned above, workaround is to rename the whole filter to something unique, add it to a board, and then rename it to its initial name. &#xd;
&#xd;
But this is odd and causes additional effort from teams' side.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please take a look at this issue.</text><author>Artem Tikhobaev</author></comments><comments><text>This is also impacting our environment, as users heavily rely on searches and shared filters. &#xd;
&#xd;
Please give some priority to this. Thanks!&#xd;

Jira 8.5.3 - Datacenter</text><author>Paulo Salvador</author></comments><comments><text>Paulo - I've been frustrated by this issue as well... but saw on another thread (which I can't find the link) that the best workaround is to do the following;&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
 # Create your query w/ the exact parameters you want, but add a single quotation mark at the beginning of the query name ("QueryName). By doing that ("QueryName) your query will come up as one of the first items on the search.&#xd;
 # Go to the board configuration ('General and filter') page &amp; try to find your query in the 'Saved Filter' section (it should be right at the top).&#xd;
 # Once you've found it, select it and leverage it for your board.&#xd;
 # Then go back to your issue queue ("QueryName) and remove the " at the beginning of your query name (since you were able to find it - and it's no longer required :) ).&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Hope the steps above helps...

Currently I'm using the workaround of saving the filter as A0, A1 etc but that will only work up to 15 boards (=number of filters listed in the "Saved filter" dropdown). We're on Jira Cloud.&#xd;
&#xd;
The way our teams and initiatives are set up, we will soon exceed that number (and I can confirm that the board is impacted once the associated filter drops off the "Saved filter" dropdown list)</text><author>Siva Chandrasekaran</author></comments><comments><text>This cost us an hour too.

&#xd;
I've just created a copy of the board (just not to spend time for configuring from scratch). I've edited a filter and saved it as a new one... BUT I can't use it cause it does not appear in a drop-down list and I CAN'T create a new filter for an existing board cause it only allows me to edit saved filter which is currently used by the board.&#xd;

Having this fixed or not makes a big difference:  if not fixed, every Program Increment I must manually re-create a set of some 16 issues, rather than clone and tweak them for the new PI.  These represent a standard set of things we must do each PI. The difference is less than an hour vs. a full day of work.&#xd;

 * Actual: Get error, "cannot clone issue, please check your connection"&#xd;
&#xd;
I also noticed that this issue was completed in a sprint which is now closed, but the sprint value isn't showing in the main field-- it looks blank, with the "+1" for being in a closed sprint. That seems strange to me, and I'm pretty sure that didn't used to happen.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
ETA: In our case, it is because we had a validation on the issue that required the affects version field, and the value in the original ticket had an archived fix version. We were able to get around this by unarchiving that version for the purposes of the clone, and then editing from there.

&#xd;
When planning team-level issues in the app, users select a series of Jira sprints for each Increment. This means that the app shows the issues from those sprints, and issues planned in Easy Agile Programs will be added to those sprints in Jira. &#xd;
&#xd;
The app also maintains two [custom fields|https://help.easyagile.com/easy-agile-programs/programs-custom-fields] for these issues based on these sprints. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Because cloned issues incorrectly receive sprint values, the app assumes that the issues should be in these sprints. It will show these cloned issues in the given sprints, and they'll also appear in JQL searches using the associated custom field. &#xd;
&#xd;
Given the app uses sprints from Jira as a "single source of truth", we're unable to correctly handle cloned issues with incorrect sprint fields. &#xd;

I have found that _cloning a single Story_ gives you the choice to include sprint values or not.  But yeah, once the deed is done, there is no way to go back and clean it up.  Haven't tried the bulk-edit workaround in a while, but it wasn't working 3 years ago when I tried it.</text><author>will.cummings</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Any gadget sends header limit error when the filter calls around 430 issues</summary><key>JSWCLOUD-20506</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-20506</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
Pie chart gadget sends header limit error when the filter calls around 430 issues.&#xd;
When clicking on any segment of the pay chart Jira sends all the called issues through the URL, if these are more that 430 the user receives a "header too large error"&#xd;
&#xd;
Problem is reported for other gadgets as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a filter with a JQL like issue in (ISS-1,ISS-2,ISS3,ISS-4...........) with more than 430 issues&#xd;
 # Create a workload pie chart gadget and use the previously created filter&#xd;
 # Click on a segment of the pie chart&#xd;

To display the information or one error indicating what is the problem&#xd;

A 400 bad request header too large error is displayed&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available&#xd;
&#xd;
In case that search does not work, it is possible to try a different approach:&#xd;
* Create a new filter and refer to the existing filter. e.g filter_new = &lt;filter used in the dashboard>&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When saving an attribute value using comma as the decimal separator, the separator is removed, leading to a wrong value. The problem is inverted (dot is removed) when using locales that default to comma (such as Dutch or German).&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Modality 1 - English locale*&#xd;
 # Create an object type with a float attribute.&#xd;
 # Give it any value with a dot decimal separator, such as 1.5.&#xd;
 # In the list view, edit the value to use a comma as the decimal separator, such as 1,5.&#xd;
 # The separator is removed and the value is saved as 15.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Modality 2 - German locale*&#xd;
 # Create an object type with a float attribute.&#xd;
 # Give it any value with a comma decimal separator, such as 1,5.&#xd;
 # In the list view, edit the value to use a dot as the decimal separator, such as 1.5.&#xd;
 # The separator is removed and the value is saved as 15.&#xd;
&#xd;
(In the object edit view, the issue was not reproducible. In this case, the separator is replaced by a dot or comma, depending on the locale, but the value is not modified).&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets should fully respect the usage of the default decimal separator, as some locale settings use commas instead of dots (for example, Dutch and German). Editing of float attributes should be saved correctly, and the values should also be consistently displayed depending on the locale.&#xd;
&#xd;
In previous versions, the error message "Number is not valid (Float)" would be displayed. Apparently, the "fix" on bug [JSDSERVER-15703|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-15703] resulted in this new behaviour.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The value is modified, as the separator is lost.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use a dot or comma as a decimal separator, depending on the case.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using the Assets Confluence Macro to display a list of objects from an object schema in Jira, hovering over attributes referencing other objects results in a pop-up. This pop-up is broken in version 9.2 of Confluence, showing only a grey box. In previous versions of Confluence, such as 8.5, the pop-up displays the correct information about the object.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Link Confluence and Jira.&#xd;
 # Install the Assets Confluence Macro in Confluence.&#xd;
 # Create a sample object schema in Jira. For test purposes, you can use the default Assets IT Service Management project with sample data in JSM.&#xd;
 # Create a page in Confluence and add the macro.&#xd;
 # Load all objects from the object schema on the page.&#xd;
 # Find an object that contains an attribute referencing other objects, such as Business Service Owner in the sample schema.&#xd;
 # Hover over an entry of this attribute type, such as the example "Wes Shults" for object "TESTITSM-100".&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Few Asset objects are currently missing from the Jira UI, and the clean reindex process fails due to an SQLException. Furthermore, the Jira assets custom field is generating an error: "Error rendering ‘com.atlassian.jira.jira-view-issue-plugin:details-module’."&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
JSM version 10.3.3 is configured with Oracle Database Server 19.26.0.0.0 and Oracle JDBC Driver 19.3. Users have reported that certain objects are missing in the user interface, and the asset clean reindex operation fails with an error. The Atlassian Jira logs are showing a recurring error: {{java.sql.SQLException: Cannot extract column 23 for type java.lang.Long}}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets clean reindex should be completed without any errors. There should not be any objects missing in the schema, and the assets custom field should accurately display the objects.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The presence of the field Due Date in a project's screens causes a null pointer exception in a clone action automation involving an Assets field copying a value from the trigger issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a sample object schema and a few objects.&#xd;
 # Create a sample project.&#xd;
 # Create an Assets object custom field, associate it with the object schema and add it to the project.&#xd;
 # In the screens for the project, add the field Due Date.&#xd;
 # In the project, create an automation rule:&#xd;
 ** When: Manually triggered&#xd;
 ** Then: Clone issue into (Same project, same issue type, Assets field "Copy Assets Field from Trigger issue")&#xd;
 ** Name it something like "Assets Clone Issue".&#xd;
 # Create a new issue in the project and add an object to the Assets field.&#xd;
 # Click on More > Assets Clone Issue. A message will state the rule was executed successfully.&#xd;
 # Go to the automation audit logs and check that the rule failed with the following error:&#xd;
** {code:java}&#xd;
Unexpected error executing rule:&#xd;
java.lang.NullPointerException&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Now, remove the Due Date field from the project screens.&#xd;
# Try the clone action again. It will work.&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) Recent reports indicate that, similar to the 'Due Date' field, any field primarily a date type that remains empty can result in a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) error. This occurs when using the clone/create option, which involves an operation to copy the values of Asset fields within the Automation rule (A4J).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is cloned successfully.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The automation rule fails.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
If only the Due Date or any other removable field is involved, it could be removed from the issue view. However, if the situation involves essential custom fields that must be copied, it is advisable to implement an IF condition in the rule to verify the value of these specific fields for the time being.</description><createDate>2025-03-19T15:52:01.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>The creation or editing of assets objects fails due to a NullPointerException.</summary><key>JSDSERVER-16066</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-16066</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets have a limit on the number of object attributes set to the Java integer limit of 2,147,483,647. When the number of object attributes exceeds this limit, the code will fail with a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) when new objects are created or when additional attributes are added to existing objects.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
A straightforward method to replicate this issue is to check the maximum ID in the AO_8542F1_IFJ_OBJ_ATTR table or the sequence AO_8542F1_IFJ_OBJ_ATTR_ID_seq, ensuring it exceeds the value of 2,147,483,647.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Asset object creation, editing, and deletion should function without encountering any NullPointerException.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An incomplete and non-descriptive label such as "Edit" is provided for the button.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the JSM DC Help Center instance.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "Requests" button and expand it.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "All requests" and activate it.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the mentioned button.&#xd;
 # Listen and note that the button's label is incomplete and non-descriptive.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Non-descriptive label screen recording.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate through the "Requests" page, they encounter an incomplete and  non-descriptive label, such as "Edit" for the button.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users may not fully understand the button's purpose.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The screen reader should announce unique and descriptive labels for buttons to ensure users can easily understand their purpose.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this case, update the value of the "aria-label" attribute to "Edit visible columns" to provide a clear and specific description of the button’s function.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Note: Before implementing the label for this control, please consult with the content design team to determine the best label for this approach.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Reconfiguring the automation action to utilize an HTTP Request or executing a Groovy script can serve as a viable workaround, if feasible.</description><createDate>2025-02-21T02:52:22.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>SLA does not stop if the "Resolution" has been set twice within a workflow transition</summary><key>JSDSERVER-16048</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-16048</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
SLA does not stop if the "Resolution" has been twice in the same workflow transition.&#xd;
For example, setting a "Resolution" field through workflow transition post function, whilst closing the issue through REST endpoint and setting the "Resolution" value within.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Modify used workflow and add a post function to set Resolution field (e.g. to "Done"). Publish the workflow&#xd;
# Create a SLA that has Stop condition "Entered Status: Done"&#xd;
# Create a JSM issue that has the SLA from step 2 applied, and running once the issue is created&#xd;
# Close a request through REST endpoint [for issue transition| https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/9.12.0/#api/2/issue-doTransition]. Make sure to include "Resolution" value "Done" in the REST request body.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The SLA stops, regardless if the issue has been closed through REST request or through UI.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The SLA keeps running once the issue has been closed through REST endpoint.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h5. Workaround 1&#xd;
One needs to make sure that the "Resolution" value is set only once:&#xd;
* Through Workflow screen pop-up,&#xd;
* Through Workflow post-function,&#xd;
* or through REST request.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Workaround 2&#xd;
Move the post function step to after the issue history event, then the problem can be avoided as JSM will see the original history item.&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
When moving issues with Asset Custom Fields that have Filter Issue Scope defined, it fails to move the issue due to error {*}Could not find Asset object/s{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue does not occur in JSM 5.12.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
JSM 10.x&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Import object schema [^jsm-error-move-issue-obj-sche_2025-02-13T02_14_04.814Z.zip]&#xd;
 ** The object schema contains 4 objects:&#xd;

 # Create 2 Asset custom fields and associate them with Create/View screens:&#xd;
 ** Product:&#xd;
 *** !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 ** Model:&#xd;
 *** !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Create a ticket with the Product and Model fields filled:&#xd;
 ** !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Move this ticket to another issue type in the same project:&#xd;
 ** !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In JSM 5.12 (Jira 9.12), the Move Issue screen does not prompt updating the Model field:&#xd;
 * !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
This is expected as both Product and Model are not required fields.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In JSM 10 (Jira 10), the Move Issue screen prompts updating the Model field:&#xd;
 * !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
After selecting a value from the dropdown menu, it prompts error *Could not find Asset object/s* and the Move Issue process can't proceed:&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The content such as "Reference depth:", "Inbound References", "The max. number of Inbound References from the same Object Type..." and so on is marked up as description list unnecessarily. As a result, screen reader users found it difficult to understand the content structure.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen reader should announce the content as plain text for their users.&#xd;

Remove description list from the mentioned content and code it within &lt;div> element. In addition, if required CSS can be used to maintain the presentation of the page if required.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the users perform a valid “Search” operation in the “What do you need help with?” input field, search results are getting updated below the respective input field and for invalid search operations the message such as "No matching search results" displayed on the page which is not announced by screen reader. The programmatic means of identifying the presence of search result messages and suggestions are not used, so assistive technologies such as screen readers are not able to alert users to the presence of the status message/search results. Although this interaction is easier to understand for sighted users, it is not intuitive for the visually impaired.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes&#xd;
 * Ensure that the search results/status messages that become available when the user search for inputted data in the “What do you need help with?” input field should get announced by the screen reader.&#xd;
 * Provide the aria-live region for the search result message such as "No matching search results" which becomes available when the user performs an invalid search operation.&#xd;
 * Screen reader users should be notified when the suggestions get updated in the below along with the count of suggestions. For eg: “ 4 results found” Live regions can be used to achieve this behaviour.&#xd;
 * If this is not feasible, a hidden instruction should be announced (when the search input receives focus), notifying the users of the dynamic change. For eg: Typing letters in the search input fields update the search results, press the tab key to view the list of suggestions.”.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using Jira with German locale, the behavior for editing float values is not consistent.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up a Jira environment with *German* [locale.|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/change-locale-for-jira-server-314450433.html]&#xd;
 # Create a test object schema.&#xd;
 # For any object, create an attribute of type {*}float{*}.&#xd;
 # When adding or editing a value for a float attribute in the *Object Schema* view, if you add the number using a comma (the standard for German locale), the error message "{_}Value is not valid (Float){_}" will be shown. The error does not happen if a dot is used instead of a comma, but the value will be displayed correctly with the comma.&#xd;
 # When adding or editing a value for the same attribute in the *Object* view, however, it is possible to do so using a comma *OR* a dot. However, the value is then displayed with a dot.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets should fully respect the German locale settings and allow editing of float attributes with a comma. The values should also be consistently displayed with a comma.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * When adding or editing a value for a float attribute in the Object Schema view, if you add the number using a comma (the standard for German locale), the error message "Value is not valid (Float)" will be shown. The error does not happen if a dot is used instead of a comma, but the value will be displayed correctly with the comma.&#xd;
 * When adding or editing a value for the same attribute in the Object view, however, it is possible to do so using a comma OR a dot. However, the value is then displayed with a dot.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
We could manually fix the issue, we will need to identify the affected report CRON expression and update it or temporarily change the report synchronization to once:&#xd;
&#xd;
{panel:title= Warning|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ffae42|titleBGColor=#ffae42|bgColor=#ffdb9a}&#xd;
(!) Always [back up|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html] your data before performing any modification to the database. If possible, try your modifications on a test server.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Run the following SQL query to list all the reports using the CRON expression:&#xd;

update "AO_8542F1_IFJ_WIDGET" SET "SYNC_PERIOD_CRON" = NULL, "SYNC_PERIOD" = 'ONCE'  WHERE "ID" = REPORT_ID;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) - Replace &lt;REPORT_ID> with the affected Asset report ID.&#xd;
 # {*}Or{*}, update the CRON Expression column running the SQL query below:&#xd;

{code}&#xd;
(i) - Replace &lt;CRON_EXPRESSION> with the CRON_EXPRESSION without blank space. (!) Make sure that the CRON expression is valid. &#xd;

Jira Data Center version: 4.20.16&#xd;
&#xd;
Insight version: 9.1.13</text><author>Yuki Kang</author></comments><comments><text>A short estimation of the suggested workarounds:&#xd;
 * ad 1: Scheduling is not possible since the "schedule" step would be _after_ the erroneous "test configuration" step. :(&#xd;
 * ad 2: For security reasons, we cannot / are not allowed to grant global asset permissions to all users that want to import assets since they could harm asset configurations in any other object scheme.&#xd;
 * ad 3: Since the asset functionality is intended for "normal" project admin users (no Jira specialists or Developers) workaround 3 (write an import script that consumes the asset API) would be far too technical in most cases. And one would be faced with such aspects like how to deal with existing assets that are not contained in the import file etc. - this functionality is already contained in the importer wizard which is intended to avoid such programming efforts. &#xd;
&#xd;
So basically none of these workarounds is viable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Taking into account that the original bug https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-11292 has priority 'Highest' - why has this Bug only Priority 'Low'? Keep in mind that the ability to import assets is a key functionality and a key reason to use assets in Jira!</text><author>Thomas Dupre</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Object Schema managers who are not Insight/Jira Admin will see a Permission Error when executing an import manually</summary><key>JSDSERVER-11292</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-11292</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Ever since Insight 8.6.11 / 8.6.15, the LDAP and DB imports are only configurable for Schema Managers who are ALSO Jira Admins.&#xd;
 The Permission Check seems to be triggered even on other Import Types, and generates a Permission Error, while the Import configuration can still be saved.&#xd;

The workaround we have just set is to give the Manager the role “Insight Administrator“ in the “General Configuration” section. But keep in mind this gives admin permission for every insight object schema.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In some condition. the SLA is showing in incorrect state in tickets after its configuration has been updated&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, it is showing as running while it should be paused, based on the pause condition.&#xd;
&#xd;
Note that this issue does not occur with any type of SLA configuration change, but only with configurations that involve:&#xd;
 - "Assignee: From Unassigned" as the Start Condition&#xd;
 - at least 2 "entered status" conditions as the Pause Condition&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
 - Create a an SLA in a Service Desk project called "Test SLA", using the following settings:&#xd;
 -- with "Issue Created" as the start condition&#xd;
 -- with "Status: Waiting for customer", "Status: Waiting for support" as the pause condition&#xd;
 -- any configuration for the stop condition&#xd;
 !Step1.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Create a new ticket, assign it to any user and note that the "Test SLA" is paused. This is expected, since the SLA started when the issue got created, and got paused right after because it entered the status "Waiting for support"&#xd;
 !Step2.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Modify the configuration of the "Test SLA" by replacing the start condition from "Issue Created" to "Assignee: From Unassigned":&#xd;
 !Step3.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Go back to the issue, and note that now "Test SLA" is now running (after the SLA recalculation completed):&#xd;
 !Step4.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Run the SLA reconstruction API call from [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-desk-828790603.html] to force the SLA to be recalculated against the whole issue history, and notice that the SLA is still shown as running (the API call did not help):&#xd;
 - Make any change to the ticket (for example, change the priority), and note that "Test SLA" is now paused. (!) Note that the SLA shows as 1h55min and not at 2h, meaning that the pause event was purely caused by the Priority change event and not by the "Status: Waiting for support" event:&#xd;
 !Step5.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected results&#xd;
&#xd;
After the start condition of the SLA was updated, the SLA should have been recalculated for the ticket and show the correct SLA status, which should be "Paused", since the condition "Status: Waiting for customer" is one of the SLA pause conditions.&#xd;
h3. Actual results&#xd;
&#xd;
The SLA shows as "Running", and can only be paused if any update is made to this issue, for example if the priority field is changed.&#xd;
 In addition to this, the timing of the SLA gets incorrect after it's paused, as it's using the timing when the priority field was changed, rather than the timing of the actual condition that should have paused the issue ("Status: Waiting for customer").&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
No workaround known so far.&#xd;
&#xd;
Even the SLA reconstruction API call from [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-desk-828790603.html]  won't fix the SLA.</description><createDate>2019-12-12T12:55:21.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Inconsistency with how Jira notifications are sent to users treated as Customers when they are mentioned in a ticket</summary><key>JSDSERVER-6269</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6269</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. +Issue description+&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Jira user is added as participant of a Service Desk request, this user should be treated as a customer and therefore should not be able to receive any Jira Core notification (notifications configured in the Notification Scheme, and meant for agent users).&#xd;
&#xd;
This behavior:&#xd;
- is described in the documentation [Managing service desk notifications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-service-desk-notifications-939926348.html]&#xd;
- is addressed in the feature request [JSDSERVER-6248|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6248]&#xd;
&#xd;
There are 2 scenarios where the notification mechanism is not consistent:&#xd;
- *Scenario 1:* if a user is a participant of a Service Desk request and mentioned in an internal comment, this user won't receive a JIRA Core notification from this comment (expected behavior)&#xd;
- *Scenario 2:* if a user is *both a participant and a watcher* of the ticket and mentioned in an internal comment, then this user will receive a Jira Core notification from this comment (unexpected behavior)&#xd;
&#xd;
The inconsistency between these 2 scenarios does not seem to be intentional therefore is a bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. +Expected behavior+&#xd;
&#xd;
We would expected both scenarios to lead to the same result: in both cases, the user should not receive any notification from an internal comment, since this user should be treated as a customer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Therefore, the scenario 1 is correct (based on the design), but not the scenario 2.&#xd;

&#xd;
I think the issue is similiar as above and should be addressed soon.</text><author>Riley Le</author></comments><comments><text>Hello Team,&#xd;
&#xd;
I've found that this "bug" has been "fixed" in JSM 5.17.0.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is a huge problem for us, because we were actively building on this possibility. We have more than 100 workflows and it is impossible to completly separate flows where our colleagues are acting as agents and customers are present or not. It is a common case that our colleagues are reporting tickets and until a certain status the workflow is moving in a "closed" environment and at some point we have to invite one or more customers. After that point our agents have to be able to communicate with the help of private comments, but due to the intended behaviour our reporter colleagues are not receiving notifications about comments/changes. It is crucial to get notifications in time because of our SLA-s.&#xd;
&#xd;
Workarounds such as using customer-level users for reporting issues instead of our agent users are not applicable due to the fact that we have thousands of filters and hundreds of dashboards, rewriting/duplicating that amount of JQL-s is impossible.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is also impossible to rewrite all our processes - we have more than 100 workflows as mentioned before - they have been designed to serve the needs of the company.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please consider adding the possibility to switch between the two behaviours, or at least provide a workaround to be able to return to the way Jira worked and the way that has been deemed faulty.&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
The Default service desk project configuration documentation is outdated. &#xd;
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER033/Default+service+desk+project+configuration&#xd;

The title may also need to be changed to "Default JIRA Service Desk project configuration" &#xd;

h3. Details of problem&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Database tables: &#xd;
&#xd;
The article includes database tables and this list is incomplete. Example missing would be AO_C7F17E_LINGO added in 3.3. Approvals are another example of missing tables. &#xd;
* The other content on the page appears to be things that are unlikely to change between versions. The database tables do change as new features are released.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Custom Fields&#xd;
&#xd;
The list of custom fields is outdated.&#xd;
* Other fields are included with JSD install, for example "Request Participants"&#xd;
* Creation of JSD projects results in the creation of additional custom fields. For example creating IT Service Desk project will create 17 custom fields if they do not already exist. Example field "Product Categorization"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Suggested Solution&#xd;
It is great to have the list of database tables that are related to JSD. In addition the custom fields need to be updated. &#xd;
&#xd;
If it will be difficult to keep this updated I suggest moving this to be a KB article so that support can assist with maintaining this. A link to the KB article could be placed on the documentation page.&#xd;

I can't seem to reproduce this issue with the steps provided. It sounds like the admin user doesn't have permissions to create a page in Confluence. Do you have more information regarding the permissions set up for your Confluence instance?&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;
Andrea</text><author>Andrea</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Andrea Olrich&#xd;
The main point is that application links using the "execute as" functionality should *always* call the linked application as the specified user. &#xd;
In reality, the specified user is *never* used. These different use-cases illustrate this. As a prerequisite, let's assume we have a KB space in Confluence which is not open for anonymous access, and a user Ca in confluence which has no rights for the KB space. User Cb has rights, as does user Cc. The application link from ServiceDesk to Confluence is setup using user Cb. The same user Cb is also created in ServiceDesk directly. Note that the user directories of ServiceDesk and Confluence are separated. Now for the use-cases (always user Cb logged in ServiceDesk):&#xd;
a) User not logged in Confluence --> asked for login (expected: use credentials of application link)&#xd;
b) User logged in Confluence with user Ca --> not permitted (expected: use credentials of application link)&#xd;
c) User logged in Confluence with user Cc --> works, but article is created under user Cc (seems ok, Cb would have been more consistent IMO)&#xd;
Especially use-case a) is disappointing - creating the same user/password in both ServiceDesk and Confluence has no effect, at least in this case the same user should have been used implicitly (apparently, this works in the cloud version).&#xd;
I don't remember the link, but Atlassian documentation said this should work; Julian Rahmadiputra then confirmed that it works on the cloud version, but not on the standalone (which we use).&#xd;
Searching just now, I hit this article: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/guide-to-link-knowledge-base-to-jira-service-desk-for-unlicensed-user-816677228.html which contains interesting hints like "Service desk requires impersonation" and "impersonation only works for shared user databases". &#xd;
Not sure if in the mean time there's a way to allow using a knowledge base without making it fully public. It's certainly frustrating not to have a solution for a seamless KB feature in ServiceDesk.</text><author>LEGIC IT ServiceDesk</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,   Let me clarify that this issue is occurring with our JIRA instance of ServiceDesk that is a SERVER (on Prem) instance and our CONFLUENCE instance is a CLOUD hosted instance.&#xd;
&#xd;

a) click "Create KB article" and&#xd;
b) click "Create" &#xd;
I get the in line error message:&#xd;

"There was a problem contacting the application."&#xd;
The authentication we use for these two instances is different.&#xd;
For on-preim (Jira) we are using our Windows SunriseCorp AD domain accounts in the Sunriseid.com domain, for the cloud (Confluence) we are using a Matching username (bob.stahr@sunriseid.com) but the password and account is in the a atlassian.net domain.&#xd;
&#xd;
I hope this clarifies the set up.&#xd;
</text><author>Help Desk</author></comments><comments><text>Hi [~helpdesk2],&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you for the detailed response. I can now see that the issue here is that there has been a misunderstanding on how the "Execute As" user works. Configuring a user and specifying them as the "Execute As" user in your Two-legged OAuth setup means that this user will be used to execute all *search* requests via by the application link from JIRA Service Desk to Confluence.&#xd;
&#xd;
This user and the application link is not used for creating an article (or any other action between JIRA Service Desk and Confluence). As shown in the document linked, viewing an article also requires the user to have their own credentials in Confluence.&#xd;
&#xd;
The intended purpose of the Execute As feature is to allow customers to search the Knowledge Base through the portal when there is not a shared user base (i.e. when a user has both Confluence and JIRA Service Desk accounts, but the credentials are different).&#xd;
&#xd;
This guide might provide some more information: https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver030/serving-customers-with-a-knowledge-base-761768892.html, in particular under "How to choose the user that you want searches to be performed as". &#xd;
&#xd;
On a different note, the problem you are experiencing with being unable to create an article with your setup is most likely due to not having impersonation and a shared user base. There is a ticket already describing this problem and I recommend that you watch it for updates: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-4071&#xd;
&#xd;
I hope this is helpful in at least clarifying the problem. If you have any further questions please ask.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;

Correct, most explanation I saw assumed a shared user database, which we do not have and cannot have for various reasons.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Previously we had this bug that was recently fixed by our Engineering team:&#xd;
 * JSDCLOUD-15831 - Team-managed project custom field linked to Form field does not show on REST API view and automation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround suggested on that bug says that:&#xd;
{quote} Workaround&#xd;
 * Replace the team-managed custom field by a global custom field.&#xd;
 * In automation rules, use [forms smart values|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/access-smart-values-for-forms-and-form-fields/] to retrieve the field value.&#xd;
 * Add the Custom Field in Request Form and save it. Then Remove the Custom field from From Request Form and Save.{quote}&#xd;
Now, we can't use the [API|https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/find-the-smart-value-for-a-field/] to find global fields in team-managed issues, as no results will be returned.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a custom field and make sure that it has a global context (all issues);&#xd;
 # Associate it with all screens/projects;&#xd;
 # Create a Form on a TMP and link the Form field with this custom field we've just created;&#xd;
 # Select any issue from a team-managed project and search for this new field using the [API|https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/find-the-smart-value-for-a-field/] ;&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
According to the workaround suggested in the previous bug, we should be able to find this custom field within a team-managed ticket.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The field can't be found in team-managed project issues using the following endpoint:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
https://yoursite.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/ISSUEKEY?expand=names{noformat}&#xd;
PS: It doesn't matter if we link the custom field with a Form field, the field won't be displayed on the API response.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When raising a request via email it's expected that the Request participants in 'CC' will receive the Request created customer notification, if they are a part of the original message. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is not happening in cases where there are attachment included, and in some scenarios were the message is being forwarded. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make sure you have the Request created customer notification enabled&#xd;
 # Send an email with attachment and users in CC to JSM mail handler&#xd;
 &#xd;
 Or&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Make sure you have the Request created customer notification enabled&#xd;
 # Send a message from email1 to email2&#xd;
 # As email2, forward the message to JSM mail handler having email1 as CC&#xd;
 ** This second set of steps only replicate the inconsistency in some sites not all. If they include an attachment, then it should replicate in all sites.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The users in CC should be added in as Request participants and receive the Request created and Participant added customer notifications.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The users are added in CC, but only receive the Participant added customer notifications. The Request created is not received.&#xd;

No clear replication steps because it is difficult to understand the cause. While there can be *many different* causes, one can be when a customer signs up to a FREE site and very quickly upgrades to PREMIUM. Exact cause is unknown and hence there can be more situations leading to this bug behaviour.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
We're experiencing intermittent delays in syncing events between JSM Chat tickets and JSM work items, particularly during usage spikes. This affects various event types, including ticket creation, work item updates like transitions, and comments. The delays seem tied to queue usage spikes, resulting in slower propagation of updates to Slack or JSM depending on the origination of the event. This issue impacts timely communication and workflow efficiency between JSM and Slack integrations.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
N/A (Delays are intermittent depending on queue usage spikes)&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Work item events are synced in a reasonable timeframe (ideally occurring within a few seconds rather than stretching into many minutes)&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;

Work item events take anywhere from 5-10 minutes to sync&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Issues imported via External System Import using a .csv file, in a workflow that has an approval stage immediately after creation, get stuck in approval if created in a status after the approval.&#xd;
&#xd;
If the workflow has a status between the creation and the approval step, the behavior doesn't happen. Only if the approval is immediately after creation.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a workflow with an approval stage in the first status after creation&#xd;
 # Import an issue via .csv in any status after the approval&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is imported in the target status and since the status doesn’t have an approval stage, no approval is required.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * The issue is on a status without approval stage, but it shows as if approval is required.&#xd;
 * The option to approve or decline doesn’t display in the issue view&#xd;
 * Trying to override the approval stage via automation doesn’t work as well&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Transition issues back to the approval stage and transition the issue through the workflow.</description><createDate>2025-03-03T15:23:30.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>No translation for 'Help Center' under portal</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-16023</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-16023</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If a JSM form is associated with a request type, it is possible that the page loads, but the form does not, due to unreliability in the customer's Jira database. &#xd;
In some situations, if the form has required fields and this bug is triggered, the request can be submitted without those fields being filled in&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
It is an intermittent issue that is dependent on the load on the tenant Jira database.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If JSM form load is unavailable due to Jira unavailability, then Portal create page should not load or be able to be submitted without a form.&#xd;

 # Seelct the organisation in the ticket&#xd;
 # Click on the request participant field&#xd;
 # All the JSM customer accounts show up including Atlassian accounts irrespective of the customer sharing permission&#xd;
 # When populated, it disappears from the selection.&#xd;

 # Enable virtual agent with intents in your environment.&#xd;
 # Open help centre and do not select any portal start a conversation with the virtual agent.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Conversations should be recorded in the conversation tab on Jira agent view.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Conversations are not recorded in the Conversation tab.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Once you login to the help centre select the portal in which you want to raise the ticket and then start the conversation.</description><createDate>2024-12-30T17:42:17.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Form: Insufficient color contrast for selected state of user interface controls</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-15650</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-15650</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
The color contrast fails to meet the minimum requirement of a 3:1 ratio for the selected user interface controls.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the Help Center page in JSM.&#xd;
 # Navigate to "Portals" section and activate "Demo Service Project".&#xd;
 # Navigate to "Contact us about" and select "General" option.&#xd;
 # Navigate to "What can we help you with?" and select "Dummy Request" option.&#xd;
 # Fill the form and submit the form by activating the "Send" button.&#xd;

h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
When the user submit the form by selecting the checkboxes and radio button, the "1.1.1 Non-text Content", "1.3.1 Info and Relationships" checkboxes, and "No" radio button in the selected state with foreground #A4ADBA focus indicator color has a color contrast ratio of 2.1:1 with #F4F5F7 background color.&#xd;
&#xd;
This will make it difficult for people with low vision and color blindness to identify the selected user interface controls after the form is submitted, that have insufficient contrast.&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
The contrast ratio between the foreground border color of the mentioned checkboxes and radio button and its background color should be sufficient.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the color contrast for the foreground border color of user interface controls is 3:1 with the background color.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When searching for a term in JSM help center, Jira lists knowledge base pages which matches the term, presenting accurate result. However, abruptly, it's shown that no answer could be found.&#xd;
&#xd;
After this, if we click to see search results, the page is again listed, as it happened when we started to type the term.&#xd;
&#xd;
This can cause confusion for customer experience when trying to get knowledge about the issue they're facing.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
It was possible to reproduce the issue following the steps below (texts being used as example):&#xd;
 # Link a Confluence space as the Knowledge base to a JSM project&#xd;
 # Create a new page with the title _Encompass Printing Error_&#xd;
 # For the page text use the following:&#xd;
{quote}This article demonstrates how to resolve the error shown below when attempting to print from encompass |uD83D|uDCD8 Instructions Close Encompass Open Adobe Acrobat&#xd;
Click Edit Click...Security (Enhanced) Uncheck the box for "Run in Appcenter" at the top of the page Click "Yes" at the prompt and then "OK" at the bottom of the preferences then restart the app Re-open Encompass&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
 # Publish the page and go to your JSM Help Center&#xd;
 # Search for the term *encompass* in the search bar and hit *enter* to initiate VA conversation&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, AI Answers will trigger and start typing out an output based on the article; {*}However, it abruptly terminates{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking on search results displays the article itself.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Virtual Agent will display the expected page.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Virtual Agent will ask you to rephrase the question.&#xd;

&#xd;
Originally, this was intended as an improvement where we attempt to identify hallucinated answers (incorrect or irrelevant responses) and prevent it being suggested to the user so that the user sees only high confident answers. However, the way it is being done currently is causing confusion and affecting user experience as the response is removed midway through the streaming without providing any explanations for this behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
As next steps, we will evaluate various approaches and come back with a timeline for the fix.</text><author>Shashank Rao</author></comments><comments><text>[~3491933893d1] it should be noted that, at least in our case, the solution that is briefly presented before being removed is CORRECT.</text><author>Peter Daniledes</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,&#xd;
My team is also experiencing this issue. &#xd;
When we type certain words or phrases, we initially see a response being generated, and links start to appear, but they ultimately get overwritten by the 'please rephrase' message.&#xd;
The main concern is that the words the VA is failing to recognize are the ones our users ask about the most.&#xd;
&#xd;
Can we get an ETA? Not an exact date, but at least an estimate of which quarter this fix might be deployed?&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
The “Test” accordion is not programmatically determined. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create a Jira Service Management project.&#xd;
# Access Customer Portal settings in the project.&#xd;
# Customize the Help Center layout, branding, and request types.&#xd;
# Open the “Help Center“ page.&#xd;
# Navigate to the mentioned instances.&#xd;
# Inspect the code and observe that role=”button” is defined inappropriately to the parent &lt;div> element.&#xd;
 &#xd;
 h3.Screenshot&#xd;
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The role=”button” is inappropriately defined on the parent &lt;div> of the “Test” accordion. Additionally, the aria-expanded and aria-control attribute is not defined. &#xd;
As a result, the screen reader users cannot use the accordion functionality effectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The accordion should expand/collapse when the users interact with it using a keyboard or a screen reader. The state should also be announced using screen readers for its users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes → &#xd;
&#xd;
Remove the role="button" from the parent &lt;div> element.&#xd;
&#xd;
Code "Test" with native HTML &lt;button> tag.&#xd;
&#xd;
Initially set the 'aria-expanded' attribute to 'false' for the button. Ensure that the value of the 'aria-expanded' attribute changes on user interaction via scripting to 'false' in the collapsed state and 'true' in the expanded state.&#xd;
&#xd;
Defined the id in the parent &lt;div> which contains the content such as "Dell Inc. (Dell) is committed to compliance with the..." and defined the aria-control attribute on the &lt;button> element and pass an id in it.&#xd;
&#xd;
The content should also be visually hidden when the “Test” accordion collapses in the state.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Code snippet&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;button aria-expanded="false" aria-control="one" class="sc-chbbiW iWJLMX">Test&lt;/button>&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When migrating "Portal only customer" to "Atlassian Account" it may result this error in the UI "Something went wrong. Try again later."&#xd;
Despite the error, an Atlassian Account with a Jira Service Management customer license is created. However, the Portal-only-customer account status remains "Active."&#xd;
It failed due to the Portal-only-customer being a request participant for a big amount of tickets. (more than 70K tickets)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create 70k tickets and assigned the customer account as request participant&#xd;
# Go to admin.atlassian.com > Products > select "site" > Portal-only customers&#xd;
# Select a user > Action > Migrate to Atlassian account&#xd;
it shows error.&#xd;
"Something went wrong&#xd;
Try again later."&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The portal-only customer should be migrated to an Atlassian Account, and the user status should change to "Inactive."&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Atlassian account created but portal only customer account still set to Active. The "Something went wrong. Try again later." error will pop up.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
# Manually retry:  Data migration for migrated account are idempotent which means they can be harmlessly retried as many time as you wish.  If any data migration fails, the portal only customer account will remain active so just keep retrying until it succeed. But wait at least 3 minutes between retries &#xd;

This is happened if the site has many projects and the user has access for more than 1000 projects.&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is 1000 projects limits which backend system can retrieve the user's projects.&#xd;
So if the user has access for more than 1000 projects as an agent (permission: SERVICEDESK_AGENT, BROWSE_PROJECTS, ASSIGNABLE_USER), system fails to get the user's permission for the project. Then Assist remove the user from the channel.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
As presented on [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5901:]&#xd;
{quote}When an issue type is changed on a ticket, it will break the request type mapping and the request type field will be displayed as {_}No match{_}. However, if the ticket is viewed in the issue navigator list view, the request type field shows the previous request type value so searching for request type null/empty would not return a value.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Which resulted on:&#xd;
{quote}As the original Request Type is still stored on the Issue (despite the Issue Type and Request Type not matching), we have changed the behaviour so that the original Request Type will now show on the Issue View (as it does in Filters &amp; Queues).&#xd;
&#xd;
On Issue View, we have highlighted that the Request Type is Invalid so that users can select a valid Request Type for that Issue Type - this will then update the Request Type value on the Issue, and the new value will show in all views (Queues, Issue View, etc).&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
However, providing a value to the [Request Type field is not required (JSDCLOUD-8406)|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-8406], so if no Agent fixes the value, then any Workflow validators that would verify if this field was not populated won't work. This occurs when changing the issue type directly or moving issues to own/other projects.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a ticket via the customer portal. Make sure the request type is valid.&#xd;
 # Change the issue type of the ticket OR move the request into another Project&#xd;
 # Do not pick a new value to the "Request Type" field&#xd;
 # Use any transition associated with the issue that has a Validator for "Request Type" field (Field Required Validator)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Transition would fail with the associated error message on the Validator&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue status transition occurs even with "Request Type" presents an invalid value&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Multiple workaround options are available:&#xd;
 * Use [Automation to set Customer Request Type When Issue is Moved or Created via Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/automatically-set-customer-request-type-when-issue-is-moved-or-created-via-jira-1026039858.html].&#xd;
 * Configure [Default Request Types for your Issue Types|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/choose-default-request-types-for-your-issue-types/].&#xd;
 * If by any reason a static Request Type value cannot be set by the above options (e.g. JSM Agents must decide the appropriate one for each issue), then it will be necessary to set a [Value Field Condition|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-advanced-issue-workflows/#Conditions] instead of a Validator. That way, the transition will NOT be available, unless one of the matching Request Types is set.&#xd;
&#xd;
Theres a caveat to the third option above, due to the bug [JRACLOUD-79309|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-79309] the solution shared on [Using Customer Request Type in a Workflow Condition|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management/Using-Customer-Request-Type-in-a-Workflow-Condition/qaq-p/709177] must be used, where a portalKey and Key pair for EACH request type is used as condition:&#xd;
 # Get issue ID (not key) by hovering over the "move","convert to subtask", or other ption from the ".." dropdown.&#xd;
 # Use the ID on the following endpoint this to the endpoint:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://&lt;siteName>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/request/&lt;issueID>/request-types{code}&#xd;
^Update &lt;siteName> and &lt;issueID> accordingly^&#xd;
&#xd;
 # The response will contain several entries, one for each request type, look for this information:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{&#xd;
[...]&#xd;
      "id": 15,&#xd;
      "cvId": 1,&#xd;
      "portalKey": "itsm",&#xd;
      "portalId": 1,&#xd;
      "key": "newhires",&#xd;
[...]&#xd;
    }&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Note the "portalKey" and "key" pair values in the response, there will be one set FOR EACH Request Type available on the project.&#xd;
 # Combine those in as `&lt;portalKey>/&lt;key>` in the workflow "Value Field" condition, using "Option ID" and you need to perform this to all possible request types available:&#xd;

 # Ensure that you pick "Any of the Following Condition" on the Condition list:&#xd;
!image-2024-11-20-16-06-41-077.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a customer with the default language selected as *Dutch* (or anything other than what is default in the site) creates a request from the portal, the Automation rule is not able to translate Request Type and performs no action.&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens even if the rule is running with the Automation user.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Configure Request Types of a project with the language set to English.&#xd;
 # Translate the name of the Request Type to Dutch.&#xd;
 # Create an Automation rule with the condition in which the above Request Type is selected.&#xd;

&#xd;
1. Set the default language of the project to Dutch (or something else than English)&#xd;
2. Translate a request type to English&#xd;
3. Set your preferred language to English&#xd;
4. Create an automation rule that has a condition based on the selected request type. The dropdown you'll see is presented in English (the config will store the 'name' as english)&#xd;
5. Change your preferred language back to Dutch (or something else than English)&#xd;
6. Create a request based on the type that should match the automation rule &#xd;
7. The automation rule will ignore the condition (In the webhook, the request type name comes through in Dutch)</text><author>Andreas Knecht</author></comments><comments><text>This is going to be hard to fix thanks to NextGen projects. &#xd;
&#xd;
Bit of history - due to Nextgen we no longer compare field values (e.g. Request Type values) by id but by name, due to the fact that NextGen creates multiple request types with the same name, but different ids in every project, which would break global/multi-project automation rules.&#xd;
&#xd;
With this Bug in particular the root problem is that we store the field value name based on the language setting of the user configuring the rule. However we then get the field value name translated in whichever language of the user that triggered the webhook event.&#xd;
&#xd;
The only way to fix this:&#xd;
 * Get Jira to provide an 'untranslatedName' for request types (both in REST responses and webhook bodies). We do this with issue types and other things like field names already&#xd;
 * Store the 'untranslatedName' in the rule config as the name.</text><author>Andreas Knecht</author></comments><comments><text>I had the same issue reported here.

&#xd;
if you need to evaluate more than one Request Type ID, you can't evaluate a comma separated list of ID's, in our case this did not work:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{{issue.Request Type.requestType.id}}&#xd;
&#xd;
contains&#xd;
&#xd;
25,26,28 {code}&#xd;
What you want to do is, evaluate a regular expression, that contains the values and are recognized as a whole, the following is working in our environment:&#xd;
&#xd;
{{ }}&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{{issue.Request Type.requestType.id}}&#xd;
&#xd;
contains regular expression&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
By default, customer would be able to set the notification to off/on via link in the customer notification template or via portal.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both option must be click by the user. However , for this bug , the notification was set to off without human interatction.&#xd;
&#xd;
This only happened when the ticket shared with an organization and a public comment was added to the ticket and triggered the customer notification&#xd;

&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;

 # Navigate to the profile section in the service desk portal.&#xd;
 # Edit the profile details, such as the customer’s name or password.&#xd;
 # Save the changes.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Customers who are synced via SAML SSO should not be able to edit their profile information (name, password) in the service desk portal, or a restriction option should be available to prevent such edits.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Customers are allowed to edit their profile information in the portal.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no direct workaround to restrict profile editing. However, an announcement banner can be added to the service desk portal, informing users that profile changes in the Atlassian service desk portal won’t affect their SAML profile.</description><createDate>2024-09-20T16:13:29.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>As a Quick Fix, Can the change Password would be disabled for the SAML SSO Customers.&#xd;

  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Service Desk Cloud*. Using *JIRA Service Desk Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-2089].
  {panel}

h3. Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new Service Desk project.
2. Add an automation rule with the following setup:
* *WHEN*: Issue created
* *IF*: Issue matches - Issue Type is "IT Help"
* *THEN*: Transition issue to {{Respond to customer}}

3. Add the "Attachment" field to the IT Help type on the customer portal.
4. Create two issues via Service Desk > Create a Service Desk Request, one with an attachment and one without (the attachment can be anything, I've been using a text file containing the word "test").

h3. Expected results
Both issues will be transitioned to {{Waiting for customer}}.

h3. Actual results
The issue with no attachment transitions correctly, but the issue with the attachment remains in {{Waiting for support}}.
# The Customer Request view says "Your request status changed to Requester action Needed" but the status isn't updated to match: [^request.png] 
# In the database, the status actually shows that its in {{Waiting For Support}}, but the transitions on the issue shows that its in {{Waiting for Customer}}. See [^TransitionsAreIncorrect.png]
# The transition seems to have activated for a second or less, before reverting back to {{Waiting For Support}}. If you have the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin installed, you can actually see the status *was* in {{Waiting for Customer}} for one second. See [^JSUTransitions.png]
# Running the Integrity Checker for workflows shows us exactly what the problem is: [^IntegrityChecker.png] the workflow current step have been corrupted by the automation due to the attachment bug. The integrity checker is able to fix it. 

h3. Workaround
Remove the *Attachment* from the Visible Fields form so that users are forced to attach their files after the requests have been created.
Considering the same data from the *Steps to Reproduce* section, the workaround can be applied with the steps below:
# Navigate to the desired Service Desk configuration screen.
# Go to *Settings > Request Types*.
# Select *IT Help > Edit fields*.
# In the *Visible fields* section, remove the *Attachment* field.</description><createDate>2024-09-17T12:47:23.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Export HTML Report in Jira search does not show Assets objects custom field values.</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-14906</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-14906</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

We need to present monthly reports to our customers about our tickets, which must include the asset the issue was logged against. With the HTML export, this should be an easy task. Right now our only option is to use CSV export, which includes a lot of manual work to convert to acceptable form.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira Service Management, users who belong to a large number of customer organizations may find that their requests do not appear in the portal. Instead, the interface displays that no requests could be found. However, these users can still view requests specifically created by them by changing the filter option to "{*}Created by me{*}".&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Add a user to a large number of customer organizations.&#xd;

Thanks in advance.</text><author>Yatish Madhav</author></comments><comments><text>There is more to this.  Request types and recently used request types display at the bottom, allowing users to click and select them, outside of the help desk they are trying to access, causing customers (anonymous users) to click and enter tickets to help desks that do not supporrt them.  It is causing a nightmare of an issue.  You can't support customers if you don't get the tickets, and you can't support customers if you get others help desk ticket's.  It is a horrible situation and risks those of us managing these, across so many help desks, a monumental amout of extra work.  Not to mention how unprofessional of a view this as from the customer's standpoint on why is their ticket moving to a different place.  &#xd;

I am now in a situation of losing my entire organiazation's base supporting the use of JSM for helps desks for this specific reason.  We were on a campaign to using JSM as our customer facig solution, now we have halted our rollout in its entirity.  This plan has been in place for over a year, to now be in a place we have to seek an alternate solution, end result:  different product.</text><author>Karri Adkins</author></comments><comments><text>One more vote for this, I would call it a 'bug'.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In JSM Team Managed Projects, when we create a dropdown custom field in one Request Type and use it as a linked field in a Form that will later be associated with a different Request Type, the dropdown field in the form is not able to populate the options in the portal, we see a "No options" message.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. On a *Team Managed* project&#xd;
2. Go to *Project Settings* > *Request Types*&#xd;
3. On any of the existing request types, create a dropdown custom field&#xd;
4. Add details and a few options > click *Save changes*&#xd;
5. Click on the field you created and drag it to the right panel, this will remove it from the request type > click *Save changes*&#xd;
6. Go to *Project Settings* > *Forms*&#xd;
7. Create a new or edit an existing Form&#xd;
8. Add a dropdown form field, and link it with the Jira Field created earlier > click *Save changes*&#xd;
9. Navigate to the Form *Settings* panel, on the top of the screen&#xd;
10. Enable the *Attach to request types* option and select two request types: the one where you created the field and another one, where the Jira linked field was never added.&#xd;
11. Click *Save changes*&#xd;
12. Go to the portal and try to open a ticket for the Request type where the linked field was created. *The dropdown will load all the options.*&#xd;
13. Go back to the portal and try to open a ticket for the Request type that never had the linked field added to it. *The dropdown will appear without any options.*&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Forms field should load the options in the Portal even if the linked Jira field was never added to the request type. For team-managed projects, Jira Custom fields exist for the entire project, regardless of whether they were explicitly added to the request type form.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Forms loads but the dropdown field is loaded without any options.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
We must add the Jira linked field to the Request type Form, save it, then remove the field and save it again to allow the Form to recognize it.</description><createDate>2024-07-16T19:47:29.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We are going to merge this bug with https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-13206 as they are choice field caused by the same issue and have same walk around.</text><author>Lee Wang</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Clicking on a link to an article outside of spaces defined in JSM KB results in not found error</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-14409</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-14409</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
While raising requests in Customer Portal, the on-screen keyboard is covering major part of the date time picker. In iPad, the on screen keyboard takes most of the space degrading the user experience - per my measurements, 34.5% space is available for the portal, once the keyboard pops up.&#xd;

Reproduced in: iPad 12 pro (5th gen), iPad Air 3rd gen&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira Service Management approval notifications are not being sent if the approval step is set on the first status.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: No&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
If the approver selection is done during the issue creation step,&#xd;
 * Set up approval to be the first status of the workflow.&#xd;
 * Set up approval selection via the approval field (or other custom field) during issue creation.&#xd;
 * Create the issue, and define the approver during creation.&#xd;
 * *No approver notifications are received.*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Approver notifications are expected to be sent.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No notifications are sent.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
No workaround is available; the customer needs to interact with it (removing and re-adding the approver) or include another step before the approval in order to get the approver notified.&#xd;

 # Update current approvals automation to include the following:&#xd;
 ## Add a 'Re-fetch issue data' action&#xd;
 ## Add a 'Send Email' action with 'Approvers' as 'To':&#xd;
 ### Set Content:&#xd;
 #### This request \{{issue.key}} created by \{{issue.reporter.displayName}} is awaiting approval.&#xd;
 #### Please click here to Approve / Decline the request:&#xd;
 #### &lt;a href="\{{issue.url.customer}}">View Request&lt;/a> &#xd;
&#xd;
Results in an email with a simple link to the request via Portal.</text><author>Troy S</author></comments><comments><text>Alternative workaround.&#xd;
&#xd;
The create should go to a status called "auto triage".&#xd;
This triggers an automation to transition the ticket to the next status (e.g. Awaiting Approval) where the Approvals works as expected.&#xd;

Based on the description, Assist is not sending approval requests in Slack for the ITS service project.&#xd;

Upon reviewing the affected tickets, it looks like approval is the first status of the workflow. I was able to confirm that this is being caused by a bug. If approval is the first status of the workflow, approval notifications are not sent.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The feature for automatically adding customers to organizations based on their domain, as detailed in [Managing customers and organizations on Jira Service Management|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management-articles/Managing-customers-and-organizations-on-Jira-Service-Management/ba-p/2677857#M4206], is not functioning as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite proper configuration, customers sometimes are not automatically added to designated organizations. This affects both Atlassian accounts and Portal-only accounts&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
This is not consistently reproducible &#xd;
 * Add a domain mapping to an organization as per [Managing customers and organizations on Jira Service Management just got easier!|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management-articles/Managing-customers-and-organizations-on-Jira-Service-Management/ba-p/2677857#M4206]&#xd;
 * Configure User Access Settings for that same domain to have the customer role for JSM&#xd;
 * Have a new account with the email domain configured above sign up to the Help Center&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user is added automatically to the designated organization&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user may not be added automatically to the designated organization.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Manually add the user to the organization</description><createDate>2024-06-03T07:18:26.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I understand this is rated low given the workaround, but please understand that a member of my support team needs to have org admin level access so they can manage organizations (not ideal), and must monitor new registration email notifications multiple times a day, and then check to see if they were properly added to the organization, otherwise add them manually. Our situation is such that if a user navigates to our help portal, they self-register to submit requests, view our knowledge base, and engage with us on tickets. It is manually intensive to have to validate they were added to the proper organization - and I can confirm this is inconsistently reproducible, we have to add ~50% of new users manually. This is error prone, and a problem because if not done in a timely manner, the customer notifies us that they cannot see their requests, which spins off an entirely new discussion to explain why. Thank you for considering this and hopefully moving this up in priority.</text><author>Zane Shewalter</author></comments><comments><text>We have the same problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, we aim to map customers automatically to organizations based on their domain. We use SAML SSO, so our customers can log in to the customer portal of JSM. When a customer with a specific domain that is already linked to an organization logs in and submits a ticket, the customer is not automatically added to the organization. And since we don't know the E-Mails of our customers beforehand, we don't have a workaround for this. So this bug is somehow critical for us. We would have to check every time a customer submits a ticket and map him to an organization. </text><author>Hamdad Mohamed Amin (C/HRE-JMP4-DE BD/SIX-AP)</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
While raising requests in Customer Portal, the on-screen keyboard is covering major part of the drop down menus and the menu floats around the page without link to the input field. In iPad, the on screen keyboard takes most of the space degrading the user experience - per my measurements, 34.5% space is available for the portal, once the keyboard pops up. &#xd;
&#xd;
Reproduced in: iPad 12 pro (5th gen), iPad Air 3rd gen&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Configure a JSM project to have drop down menu field.&#xd;
 * Open customer portal on iPad and navigate to drop down menu.&#xd;
 * Select the drop down menu field and move the page up/down.&#xd;
 * The drop down menu will start floating away from the input field.&#xd;
!Floating_Drop_down_menu.jpg|width=284,height=194!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The drop down options should use the available space to display rather floating away.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The drop down is either partially visible making the selection difficult or move away from the input field.&#xd;

It allows our customers to use request forms that they should not have access to.  Additionally it undermines their trust in the search feature.  When it returns results that it clearly shouldn't, customers will quickly lose faith in the search's ability to correctly find what they are looking for and stop using it all together.  This will negatively impact our ability to ensure as many tickets are diverted as possible with the self-help articles we publish.&#xd;

I believe for an array you would use isEmpty without the parentheses.   And in other cases you check for null with something like  \{{if(equals(variable,NULL),"None",variable)}}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When someone searches for spaces in Link Spaces in the JSM Project linked to the on-prem Confluence site, the search doesn't work. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create an app tunnel and app link between the cloud JSM and On-prem Confluence using this [link|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/configure-application-tunnels/]. &#xd;
 # Go to JSM project > Project Settings > Knowledge Base, and then click on link space. &#xd;
 # In the drop-down menu, try searching any existing spaces.&#xd;
 # This is a problem if the customer has thousands of spaces. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We shall get the expected search results back. For example, Co should return all the spaces starting with Co. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No results are returned.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
When the space is not listed in the dropdown due to the known bug, there is a REST API method that may work, this requires some familiarity with browser Developer Tools and the Terminal tool:&#xd;
 * Navigate to {*}Project Settings > Knowledge Base>, and click on Link Space{*}.&#xd;
 * Select the Confluence server and space. If the desired space is not available in the dropdown, then open *Developer Tools in your browser first* then link *any listed space* from the drop down.&#xd;
 * In the Developer Tools' network tab, locate the linked-spaces endpoint, right-click it, and select "Copy as cURL".&#xd;
 * Paste the cURL command into a text editor and modify the following parameters:&#xd;
 ** spaceName&#xd;
 ** spaceKey&#xd;
 ** Set isConfluenceServer to true&#xd;
 ** It should look something like below:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
--data-raw '{"applinkId":"&lt;YOUR_APP_LINK_ID>","isConfluenceServer":true,"spaceDetails":[{"spaceName":"&lt;YOUR_SPACE_NAME>","spaceKey":"&lt;YOUR_SPACE_KEY>"}]}'&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * After making the above changes, paste the entire cURL command into a command-line terminal and execute it.&#xd;
 * Refresh your webpage to check if the Confluence space is now linked.</description><createDate>2023-12-01T03:49:58.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Team Managed projects - The message to unlink fields from the form is being shown when not expected causing confusion</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-13270</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-13270</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
*This is specific to Team Managed projects.* &#xd;
&#xd;
As per recent release to avoid duplicate fields from being shown in the portal&#xd;
&#xd;
[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2023/10/atlassian-cloud-changes-oct-23-to-oct-30-2023#AtlassianCloudchangesOct23toOct30,2023-jira.service.management]&#xd;
&#xd;
now, when the user links a field in the form to a Jira field that is used in the Request Type (request form), then in the form builder, the user is shown the message indicating that duplicates would be removed from the request type configuration to allow this linking and when user clicks {*}Remove Fields{*}, they are allowed to save the form.&#xd;
&#xd;
!Message-about-duplicates-form-builder.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
On navigating to the Request Form now, the field is not actually removed but a message says the field will not appear in some places in the portal. So user believes the duplicate issue is taken care of. In the portal now, the field  (in this case Description field) is not shown but the field on the form is shown - which is expected behavior.&#xd;
See screenshot below.&#xd;
&#xd;
  !request-form-message-about-duplicates.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
But then, if the user makes any other changes in the Request Form and saves, the message is shown again saying that to avoid duplicates, the fields in the form will be unlinked.&#xd;
&#xd;
See screenshot below:&#xd;
&#xd;
  !message-about-unlinking-duplicate-fields.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
This is confusing because we want to let the users save their current request form format, but that means with the field not appearing in the portal, so no duplicates. In this case, telling them that we will be removing duplicates from the form and not allowing to save the request form changes until that is done is what makes the user go in circles.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note* - this is not an issue in Company managed projects because in the company managed projects, when the user clicks on Remove fields in the form after linking the form field to the Jira field, the field is removed from the Request form, but it remains in the issue view. So in company managed projects, the user can make other changes to the request form and save and the message about unlinking is not shown. This appears to be an issue for team managed projects only.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # From the form builder, link a form field to a Jira field that is also shown in the Request Form. Save changes and click on Remove fields in the message that pops up.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Request form. Make any changes and save. Now there is a message that pops up saying that the duplicate field will be removed from the form as well. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When user has consented to remove the fields from being shown in the portal to avoid duplicates, user should be allowed to make changes in the request form and save. The intent is to not allow duplicates, which is satisfied, because the field is not shown in the portal as per the message. So, the message in the Request form to unlink fields in the form should not be shown. (this is when the customer knows and acknowledges that the field in the request form that is also linked to a form field, will not be shown in the portal)&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
A message is shown to the user that we will be removing duplicates from the form and user is not allowed to save request form changes until that is done. So now the form field is also unlinked and user has to go back to the form to link the field.&#xd;
&#xd;
Refer video attached for the differences between company managed project behavior and team managed project behavior.&#xd;

h4. No more duplicate fields on forms containing linked Jira fields&#xd;
&#xd;
Avoid fields appearing twice on request types that use forms. Now when you’re in the form builder and link a form field to a Jira field that is already in use on an associated request type, we’ll remove it for you on the request form. The same goes when configuring your request types. Form fields will be unlinked in forms that contain linked Jira fields that are duplicated. This means customers and agents will no longer have to see two of the same field on the one request.&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
It's also unlinking fields that were linked in a Form, and then deleting the linked field from the request type so it won't show up in the issue view. &#xd;
&#xd;
I use Summary and Description in most of my forms and link them to other questions so I can keep the form short.&#xd;
&#xd;
The summary field links and works just fine, and never gets deleted because it's required. &#xd;
&#xd;
The description field has been getting deleted from the request type screen if it's linked to a form field. The error message appears and says it'll delete the Description field from the request type (issue view). Then when I try to open an existing ticket in the agent view/customer view, the description field is nowhere to be found. </text><author>Ben Gallant</author></comments><comments><text>Thanks Ben I'll have a look into that</text><author>Tyler Wang</author></comments><comments><text>Hi everyone,&#xd;

Same issue as https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-78327 but for portal transitions only. &#xd;

&#xd;
In Team Managed Projects, If we create a custom field of *Checkbox/Dropdown* type in one Request Type and create a Form for different Request with same custom field, then the Checkbox field or drop down field does not appear in  forms configured in portal/request forms or create new issue section. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a service project has Default mail account and custom mail account for receiving requests, then project administrators are unable to change the request type of either of these accounts.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Service project should have a Default mail account and a custom mail account in the Emails Requests page of the project&#xd;
 # Ensure that the user who is trying to make the change of the emailed request type is a project administrator&#xd;
 # Even when the emailed request type is saved the selected emailed request will not show up and the old value would continue to show up without any errors.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Project administrators should be able to change the emailed request type even if the project has both Default mail account and custom mail account. Project administrators are able to change the request type for emailed request when the project has only Default mail account.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The below error is seen in browser console when a project administrator makes changes to a service project that has a default mail account and a custom mail account&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When emails contain +inline embedded images in HTML format (base64)+, the email body exceeds the character limit in Jira Service Management's Description field, resulting in improper formatting and truncation.&#xd;
&#xd;
The message will be show in the description: *"...This comment is truncated as it exceeds the character limit.”*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Send an email with an inline embedded image in HTML format (base64) that causes the body to exceed the character limit.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The description should match the email body, even if it is trimmed to fit within the character limit. Inline embedded images shouldn't be included if that causes issues.&#xd;

Just to comment on this, we have started seeing this behaviour after we attached a proforma form to the request. This form has some of the fields linked to Jira custom field (to ensure we can see those in the issue view in JSM, and are able to JQL them in our filters)&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Topics in JSM are failing to load if the page is linked to Confluence Server&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
First, link your JSM Cloud to Confluence self-hosted Server/Data Center ([Application Tunnels|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/connect-to-self-managed-products-with-application-tunnels/]), then carry out either of the following:&#xd;
 # Create a topic for your help center as covered in [this article|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/create-and-manage-topics-in-your-help-center/].&#xd;
 # Save the topic configuration and page layout.&#xd;
 # Try to access the topic.&#xd;
&#xd;
OR&#xd;
 # [Setup JSM Knowledge Base|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/product-guide/getting-started/knowledge-management] on the local Confluence instance and [add Articles|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/write-knowledge-base-articles/]&#xd;
 # Search for a Knowledge Article at the customer portal&#xd;
 # Hit Enter to see the full result list and not just the pre-populated results&#xd;
 # Right click and open in new tab&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The article should load when the user clicks on the link to that page OR Opens it at a new tab&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the UI.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Not Found&#xd;
The knowledge base article could not be found.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
This happens because the faulty link does not contain the *portal ID* and correct *article ID* OR the {*}URL is missing "servicedesk/customer"{*}:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
&lt;site>.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/article/${article_id}&#xd;
&lt;site>.atlassian.net/portal/${portal_id}/article/${article_id} {noformat}&#xd;
Instead, users should be routed to:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
&lt;site>.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/${portal_id}/article/${article_id}  {noformat}&#xd;
^Note that the working URL should contain *servicedesk/customer* and both *${portal_id}* and *${article_id}*^&#xd;
&#xd;
*(!) This problem is not reproducible when linking the topics/articles to pages in Cloud. (!)*&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;

I removed the tabs and things seemed to settle down. That's unfortunate since all these extra fields on the main screen and "other fields" section make the Agent screen (Issue View) a lot harder to use and manage. I tried putting some on Forms for Agents to attach but then you have to link the form fields to Jira/JSM fields to be searchable, etc. Would appreciate an update from Atlassian on whether this will be addressed in the near future, thanks!</text><author>Susan Waldrip</author></comments><comments><text>We too have this issue.

We can create another *"Text"* type attribute (maybe Project1) in the schema and copy the project name into this attribute using the value available in the actual "Project" type attribute for Asset objects.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Jira Service Management project is configured with an Approval step in their workflow and this triggers an _Approval required_ customer notification and the notification is enabled with the _Approve_ or _Decline_ buttons, using the approval link with a user account's session silently fails.&#xd;
&#xd;
This looks to be somewhat of an edge case and a number of steps need to be in place for the issue to occur. The behavior somewhat changes on the account access to the ticket itself meaning if the account in the browser session does not have access to the ticket, the user will see a permission error in the browser.&#xd;
&#xd;
The primary problem occurs when both users (the intended approver) and the user accessing the approver link have access to view the issue. The most likely occurrence of this issue would be where a user has two active Atlassian Accounts where one account's email address is an alias to the other therefore emails are going to the same inbox.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Project setup:&#xd;
 # Create a Jira Service Management project and configure a workflow to have an Approval workflow step&#xd;
 # Configure the Project settings > Customer notifications > Approval required notification to allow approving or declining the approval step via the buttons&#xd;
&#xd;
User setup:&#xd;
 # Create an Atlassian Account for the user ie: test@example.com&#xd;
 # Create a separate Atlassian Account for the alias ie: test+alias@example.com&#xd;
 # Ensure both accounts have access to the project&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue setup:&#xd;
 # Add one of the accounts to the field configured for the approval step&#xd;
 # Ensure the other account is able to access the ticket ie they're a reporter or request participant for example&#xd;
 # Transition the issue to trigger the approval workflow so that an email is sent to the user in the approval field&#xd;
&#xd;
Browset setup&#xd;
 # Ensure that you are logged into the Atlassian Account that is not the approver in your browser&#xd;
 # When the email is received click the approve button&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user should see an error to indicate they are unable to approve the issue as they are not an approver.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The customer portal view of the ticket is loaded and no approval action is taken. This failure is silent and there is no indicator of errors to the user to suggest they are interacting with the page using the wrong account.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}Note{*}: If the _Approvers can use 'Approve' and 'Decline' buttons without being signed in_ is selected for the approval notification settings, because there is an authenticated session in the browser, this issue still happens.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The primary workaround would be to ensure the user's most appropriate account is selected for approval and they are authenticated as that user in the portal.&#xd;
&#xd;
If there is a need for the user to have multiple Atlassian accounts that share a single inbox, copying the button link and navigating to it in a new incognito or private browser window should either approve if the user does not have to be logged in or will ask the customer to authenticate in the portal.</description><createDate>2023-06-30T20:34:40.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Unable to search objects with in Assets custom field on Customer portal &amp; Issue view</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-12809</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-12809</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

This happens when the filter attribute list doesn't match the object attributes  to display list&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user should be able to search for objects&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:&#xd;

If the context field of the custom field *Approvers* (multi-user picker field) is empty and the default approvers of this field are set through the preset values option in the request form of the request type, the *Approvers* field won't display some approver names when we try to create a request for this request type from the agent view.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using a User Picker (multiple users) custom field and having preset values filled in on the Request Types Request Form the list is truncated when creating an Issue and after the issue is created. This also seems to be related to the size of the screen you are creating the Jira Issue from and how much scale that user picker field has to display those preset users.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to a Service Projects Project Settings > Request Types&#xd;
 # Select any Request Type and select the Request Form Tab&#xd;
 # Add a field you know is a User Picker (multiple users field), such as Approvers to the Request Form, and select 'Use preset value and hide from portal'&#xd;
 # Fill out for example 10 users as approvers in the Approvers field&#xd;
 # Add that field to the issue View as a Description field&#xd;
 # Create a new Jira issue with that Request Type. Only a few users will display in that Create Issue Screen and not the whole list&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All preset users defined in that user picker field are available and show in both the Request Form and Issue View of a Request Type when creating an Issue.&#xd;

&#xd;
Christian's summary seems to capture the essence of the issue.  To be clear, we are seeing different results when we create the request from the Portal versus Agent View.  When creating this request from the portal (on a request type configured as suggested by Christian), all defaulted approvers are included in the User Picker field, as expected.  But, when creating the same request using the "Create" button in Agent View, we only see a subset of the approvers get included in the same field.  So, same request type but different results depending on where the request originated.  &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In The Create Object action, when we select an object type, the object type gets cleared from the selection automatically after 1-2 seconds. However, on the left panel, we still see the old object type as a selection.&#xd;
&#xd;
This only affects Schemas with a large number of object types (more than 30).&#xd;
&#xd;
It is only an UI issue - the object type remains selected internally and the automation rule should still continue work.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}Note{*}: {color:#172b4d}+This behaviour will be the same for when you select an Object Schema in a "Lookup objects" actions.+{color}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a schema with more than 30 object types&#xd;
 # Create a rule containing the Create object action.&#xd;
 # After opening the Object type dropdown, notice that not all object types are displayed. The list returned is only a subset of all object types in that schema.&#xd;
 # Search for an object type that is NOT in the initial list and select it.&#xd;

Use Case: Automated Creation of IT Assets in Jira Cloud Automation&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}Description{*}:&#xd;
An IT administrator seeks to streamline the IT asset management process by automating the recording of new devices—such as laptops, servers, and peripherals—directly into a centralized Configuration Management Database (CMDB) within Jira. By leveraging Jira Cloud Automation, the administrator establishes an automation rule designed to add new asset objects to the CMDB in response to specific events or actions. This initiative aims to minimize manual effort and establish a consistent, centralized data source for all IT assets. However, the CMDB in Jira features an extensive array of object types (exceeding 30), encompassing a diverse range of devices, including monitors, routers, printers, and mobile devices, each with unique requirements.&#xd;
h4. Objectives of the Use Case:&#xd;
 * {*}Efficiency Improvement{*}: Automating the creation of IT assets not only saves time but also reduces the need for manual data entry.&#xd;
 * {*}Data Consistency{*}: Automated processes help mitigate the risk of errors or discrepancies in the recorded information.&#xd;
 * {*}Transparency and Availability{*}: Centralized, always-up-to-date data provides IT teams with enhanced visibility, facilitating quicker and more informed decision-making.&#xd;
 * {*}Process Optimization{*}: Through automation, assets can be seamlessly added or updated, such as when a device is inventoried, relocated, or processed at various stages of management.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Create the Automation Rule:&#xd;
 # {*}Rule Creation{*}:&#xd;
&#xd;
 ** The IT administrator initiates the process by accessing Jira Cloud Automation and crafting a new rule utilizing the *"Create Object"* function.&#xd;
 ** This rule is specifically designed to be triggered upon the receipt of a new ticket related to IT inventory for a device.&#xd;
 # {*}Object Type Selection{*}:&#xd;
&#xd;
 ** In the *"Create Object"* section, the administrator opens the dropdown menu to select the appropriate object type, such as "Laptop" or "Router."&#xd;
 ** Due to the CMDB schema containing over 30 object types, the dropdown menu only displays a limited subset of these objects initially. As a result, the desired object type must be searched manually.&#xd;
 ** Unfortunately, once an object type is selected, it is removed from the list instantly, rendering it impossible to select again, further complicating the process.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Request for Action:&#xd;
&#xd;
[~7260236ab89d] , please raise the priority for this incident. This is not merely a medium issue; the entire functionality is compromised and non-operational. Your prompt attention to this matter is crucial to restoring effective asset management capabilities.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you!</text><author>Felix Haverkamp</author></comments><comments><text>This seems like a serious flaw in a basic functionality connecting JSM and the Asset area. Being unable to save the item selected in the Object type list, but having it go to another item is beyond annoying!&#xd;

When you @ mention user in the standard issue view, the query has a 'maxResults' flag and is quite responsive. When you @ mention a user in the portal view, it's a completely different query and does NOT have a 'maxResults' flag which I'm certain is causing the huge delay in user lookups.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue occurs when you navigate to a KB article from another KB article via hyperlink&#xd;
URL does not contain the portal ID when navigating to a KB article from another KB article via hyperlink&#xd;
&#xd;
Example incorrect URL: [https://foo-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/article/642959422.|https://atendimento-totvs.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/article/642959422.]&#xd;
&#xd;
Correct URL for the same page: [https://foo-org.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/article/642959422.|https://atendimento-totvs.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/article/642959422]&#xd;
 &#xd;
The hyperlink is actually for [https://foo-org.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/servicedesk/customer/confluence-server/portal/7/shim/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=642959422.|https://atendimento-totvs.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/servicedesk/customer/confluence-server/portal/7/shim/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=642959422] &#xd;
&#xd;
This is somehow resolving into an incorrect URL (see above).&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Behavior observed in customer instance.&#xd;
&#xd;
I am unable to replicate the behavior observed in the customer's instance. &#xd;
 # Spin up a confluence server, same version as customer.&#xd;
 # Apply updates to system apps as needed/prompted&#xd;
 # Configure application tunnel &#xd;
 # Configure application link between JSM and Confluence instances using tunnel established in step 4&#xd;
 # Create a space on Confluence&#xd;
 # In this space create a parent page with a couple of child pages&#xd;
 ## One child page should be copied&#xd;
 ## Another child page should have a child of its own&#xd;
 ## One child page should be blank (to eliminate issues with other macros)&#xd;
 # In a JSM project, link to and configure the KB&#xd;
 # In the help center or portal, display the KB pages &#xd;
 # In my instance, all children links displayed and worked as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Users should be able to navigate via hyperlink to any KB&#xd;
Links will be displayed as part of project's KB and work&#xd;
Links from child pages will work&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Links do not work&#xd;
The URL when resolved, is missing the portalID&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When creating a Form that has Assets Custom Fields on it, the Preview Pane on the Form Builder doesn't use the Filter Issue Scope query for the valid options when previewing the form.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{panel:title=Update 16 Feb 2023 - This issue won't be fixed}&#xd;
This issue only affects the Form Builder Preview, the Filter Issue Scope works when a form is attached to an issue (or being used to create an issue). The reason the preview doesn't work is that the form is not associated or attached to a specific issue/request type. We are not planning on fixing this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Work around: To test this is working, you will need to actually goto to the relevant portal page, or attach the form to an existing issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;

 &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Form.&#xd;
 # Add 2 Assets Custom Fields to the Form and link them to the appropriate Custom Fields&#xd;
 # Modify one of the Assets Custom Field's configurations to use input from the other to determine the valid Objects&#xd;
 # Set the other Custom Field's value in the Preview&#xd;
 # Try to set the modified Custom Field's value.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a more detailed example, have 2 Custom Fields in your Jira Site:&#xd;
 # Affected Applications&#xd;
 # Affected Servers&#xd;
&#xd;
Configure Affected Applications to be filtered based on what is chosen in Affected Servers in the Custom Field's Configuration via the Filter Issue Scope.&#xd;
&#xd;
Put both of these Fields on a Form, linked to the Custom Fields, and navigate to the Preview Pane.&#xd;
&#xd;
Selected a Server in Affected Servers.&#xd;
See that the Applications listed in Affected Applications are all Applications, not just the ones applicable to the Server that was selected.&#xd;
i.e. Filter Scope is being applied, but Filter Issue Scope is not.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The dropdown only shows valid options for the 2nd custom field.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Assets Custom Field lists all possible options for the 2nd custom field, regardless of the 1st's value.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available</description><createDate>2023-02-09T17:51:50.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is intended behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
Filter Issue Scope is only available in the context of where an issue type is available. In the Form Builder, there is no issue type, as the form could be used on any issue type, so Filter Issue Scope is ignored. However, Filter Scope is still applied.&#xd;
&#xd;
Filter Issue Scope will be applied when viewing an issue or creating an issue, so this behaviour only affects the Form Builder.</text><author>Ryan Fallah</author></comments><comments><text>Please see the update provided in the description.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The custom detection for email signatures allows Jira administrators to configure custom texts or special characters for the Jira mail handler to detect email signatures as documented here: [Hide email signatures from the issue view and portals|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/hide-email-signatures-in-the-issue-view-and-portals/#Custom-detection]&#xd;
&#xd;
However when an inline image is added below the custom text, the image is not added as an attachment or processed, showing an error for {_}Preview unavailable{_}.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to Settings > Products > Email requests.&#xd;
 # Under the _Hide email signatures in issues and portals_ section, mark {*}Custom detection{*}.&#xd;
 # Add a text such as {_}Regards,{_}.&#xd;
 # Send an email to a Jira Service Management project's mail handler with the body containing the word _Regards,_ and an inline image underneath it.&#xd;
 # Open the created ticket, which should have a Signature section within the Description area. The image will appear broken and no attachments will have been added to the ticket.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
There seems to be a cache issue in the Project settings Request Types and Portal Settings > Portal groups screens.&#xd;
&#xd;
This causes newly created portal groups to not be displayed immediately after navigating to the Edit Portal Groups option on the request type. The newly created portal group is visible after refreshing the browser.&#xd;
&#xd;
Similarly a portal group deleted from the portal settings > portal groups screen is visible in the Request types > Edit Portal groups option. Error is however displayed when the deleted group is chosen. This also disappears only after browser is refreshed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Refresh should happen automatically on navigating to the screen from another screen on page load and should not need manual refresh.&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue was observed and video recorded on Chrome browser. Issue also seen in incognito mode.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Issue #1:*&#xd;
 # Create a new portal group by navigating to Project Settings > Portal Settings -> Portal groups; Enter a name and associate a request form and save.&#xd;
 # Navigate to Request Types screen under Project Settings. Click on Edit Portal groups from the Request type -> More options -> Edit portal groups. &#xd;
 # Newly created group that was also associated to a request form earlier is not seen here. Click cancel.&#xd;
 # Refresh the browser.&#xd;
 # Now click on More options > Edit Portal groups. The group created in Step 1 is seen now.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Issue #2:*&#xd;
 # Create a new portal group using Request types -> More options -> Edit portal groups -> Create group. Click Save.&#xd;
 # Navigate to Portal Settings -> Portal groups and delete the group created earlier and confirm deletion.&#xd;
 # Navigate back to Request types -> More options -> Edit portal groups, and the recently deleted group remains as an option.&#xd;
 # On saving after selecting the deleted group error message 'This group does not exist' is seen. &#xd;
 # Click cancel and refresh the browser.&#xd;
 #  More options -> Edit portal groups, and the recently deleted group is not shown now.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please see attached video.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
*Issue #1:*&#xd;
&#xd;
The newly created Portal group should be shown when the user navigates to the Request Types > More Options > Edit Portal groups screen, without needing a manual browser refresh.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Issue #2:*&#xd;
&#xd;
The deleted portal group should not be shown as an option in Request Types > More Options > Edit Portal groups screen when the user navigates to this screen.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If you have a workflow transition where you can "move" issues from "Any Status" to "Itself", you cannot use this transition from the Project Queue view (bulk transition) for any issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
The use case for this setup:&#xd;
&#xd;
While having different queues within the same project, users might need to move the tickets between the queues, and change/add values for different fields and components. With that, having a transition from any status to itself and adding a transition screen for that helps to address this requirement.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An approval step has two transitions. We have the option to uncheck 'show transition in the customer portal' for each transition but it does not seem to be honored - even if the deny transition is unchecked to not have it show in the portal the Approve and Deny buttons are shown allowing the user to transition to denied from the portal. If this is the case, why have the option to uncheck/check the box?&#xd;
&#xd;
This is important because Customer transitions in the portal behave differently than other workflow transitions as specified in the [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/show-a-workflow-transition-in-the-portal/]. Unfortunately, Conditions or validators do not apply to the customer portal. There is sometimes a need to hide or block certain transitions from showing up in the customer portal.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the agent view, select a workflow step that has an approval configured.&#xd;
 # Ensure that 'show transition in the customer portal' is checked for the Approve transition only.&#xd;
 # Ensure that the 'show transition in the customer portal' is *unchecked* for the Denied transition.&#xd;
 # Save and publish the workflow&#xd;
 # Create a ticket that uses this workflow and select approver if required.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the ticket on the customer portal as the approver and verify if the option to Deny is not shown&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Approver should not see the Deny option in the portal&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Approver is shown both Approve and Deny options&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Instead of configuring an approval the workaround would be to use a normal transition.</description><createDate>2022-09-27T17:05:58.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is an interesting ticket, thank you for raising it! The way the Approvals function is structured is as a module that gathers Approve/Decline recommendations, then performs a transition on the approvers' behalf. This model is why you’re seeing the behaviour you are – the transition setting is not applied because you’re not seeings transitions in the portal, you’re seeing an Approval module. That being said, what you’ve reported does make a lot of sense. What we’re going to do is move this ticket to our long term backlog, so we don’t lose it, it can gather popularity, and so we can consider it in future feature planning.</text><author>Brian Doidge</author></comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - September 29, 2023|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
We have recently rolled out a feature that will render the KB articles from the customer portal in a improved and cleaner way. Though, it seems that there are some issues when the articles have anchors.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Upon [connecting your JSM project to a Confluence space|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/set-up-a-knowledge-base-so-customers-can-serve-themselves/], go to Confluence and create a new page using the current editor;&#xd;
# Add some [Lorem Ipsum|https://www.lipsum.com/] text to the page, so it can be long enough to be scrolled;&#xd;
# At the bottom of the page, add an Anchor macro;&#xd;
# Highlight a piece of text in the first line of your text, in the top of the page, then hit *CTRL + K* / *Command + K* to insert a hyperlink;&#xd;
# In the link, insert _#AnchorName_;&#xd;
# Publish the page;&#xd;
# Navigate to this article in your customer portal and click over the anchor link you created.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
You are placed where you added the anchor, in the bottom of the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
There are two outcomes we can get:&#xd;
* After 3-5 seconds we are redirected to the anchor;&#xd;
* Nothing happens at all (this one occurs more often when you have more than one anchor link)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Engage with the support team raising a [new support ticket|https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/] and ask them to disable this feature for now, so the anchor links will work properly.</description><createDate>2022-07-25T16:51:13.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi Team, &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Users (be it SSO enabled or manually invited) are unable to access spaces linked to JSM projects as knowledge base articles&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
- Create a JIRA project (Service Project). (A respective KB space will already gets created on confluence)&#xd;
- Go to Project Settings -> Knowledge Base -> Who can access = “All Logged in users”.&#xd;
- Invite a test user to the site with no Product Access.&#xd;
- Go to Org Portal -> Products -> User Access Settings -> Approved Domains _(There must not be any domain with pre-approved access, specially the domain of the user that you are testing with)_&#xd;
- Make sure that the test user is not logged in to any of the Atlassian/confluence site on the browser where you are testing. So, better try in incognito mode. _(Else, you will not be able to replicate the bug, because once the user is logged in to any of the confluence sites, the system will allow the user to enter the KB confluence space without any error.)_&#xd;
- Copy the KB confluence page URL, and try accessing it with the Test user’s account in Incognito mode.&#xd;
- The error will show up.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Unlicensed users should be able to access the Confluence page with a direct URL to the space.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 - Access the direct link to the knowledge base article, it takes you to id.atlassian.com for login and after login throws an error: &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An *Object Schema Status* configured in an Insight Status attribute will display as "Unknown" within an Insight Custom Field in the Customer Portal when raising a request.&#xd;

{*}Note{*}: This issue only occurs when raising requests through the portal. When creating an issue from within Jira, the Status attribute value/label displays correctly&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*1. Insight Object (Schema) configuration*&#xd;
 * Configure a status within an Object schema&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 2.39.16 pm.png|thumbnail!&#xd;

*!Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 2.45.25 pm.png|thumbnail!*&#xd;
&#xd;
*3. Request type configuration*&#xd;
 * Add the Insight custom field to the *Request from* section to any request type configured within the portal&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 2.46.10 pm.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
*4. Navigate to the portal, and create a new request of the above-configured request type*&#xd;
&#xd;
*5. Select the Insight Custom field and search for the Object containing the Object schema status*&#xd;
&#xd;
*6. Notice the value/label is "Unknown"*&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Display the *value/label* of the Status attribute.&#xd;
&#xd;
This works as expected for *Global insight statuses:*&#xd;
&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2022-07-13 at 2.43.02 pm.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Object schema statuses are displayed as "Unknown" in the portal request view&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Configure a Global status instead of an Object Schema status if you need to display the value of the status within an Insight Custom field on the Portal.</description><createDate>2022-07-13T04:50:23.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - July 13, 2023|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using Jira Service Management's *Forms* feature with a Date and Time field that is set to required on the form, a validation error for the time field prevents issues raised via the Customer Portal from sending.&#xd;
&#xd;
The time field displays an error {_}Enter a valid value{_}, even though such is entered. This behavior impacts browsers within mobile devices and not the Jira Cloud mobile application.&#xd;

This is currently confirmed to impact iOS devices.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When we have different automation rules and/or API requests that are triggered at the same time to add different forms, some forms may not be added to the ticket. There is a concurrency/race condition problem occurring when multiple *Attach forms* actions are triggered simultaneously. So, if we add two forms at exactly the same time, one of them may end up becoming overwritten.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Create different automation rules to attach different forms to the ticket using the same trigger(i.e. {_}Issue created{_}) and/or use concurrent public API requests to attach forms to the issue.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The forms will be added to the ticket.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Some forms will not be attached to the ticket, even though the Audit log associated with the automation shows that the form has been attached and/or the public API request was successful.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The current workaround is to restructure the logic and rules so that only one Forms action executes at a time on the issue. We can see more details about it in the following document:&#xd;
 - [Forms not adding to issue via automation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/forms-not-adding-to-issue-via-automation-1311474136.html]</description><createDate>2022-06-29T15:53:55.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This has been highlighted by Atlassian support as also an issue for REST API for submitting forms during the same transaction window because the forms object on the issue cannot handle concurrent calls.&#xd;
&#xd;
The REST API puts the request on a queue, so the response from the service is that it was successful, even though only one of the API calls were honoured. So, there is nothing in the HTTP response values to indicate that all other calls were dishonoured.</text><author>Ben Salvage</author></comments><comments><text>We are moving where forms data is stored and changing how the form index is stored to solve this concurrency bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
(This means that forms data will no longer be available via the Jira entity property REST API, and the Forms REST API will need to be used instead.)&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
JSM permission validator asks to grant to "Service Project Customer - Portal Access" users all permissions including Assign and Delete, even though they are not mandatory permissions.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to Jira Service Management Permission Scheme for a test Project&#xd;
 # Validate {*}Assign{*}/{*}Delete Issues{*} Permission is assigned to the Role *Service Project Customer - Portal Access*&#xd;
 # Remove either or both {*}Assign{*}/{*}Delete Issues{*} Permission per below screenshot  !Screenshot 2022-02-01 at 7.11.59 PM.png|width=474,height=265!&#xd;
 # Browse through the issue and navigate back to the Jira Service Management Permission Scheme for above test Project and we are presented with the Permission error below:  !image-2022-02-01-19-15-24-029.png|width=675,height=309!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We should not have been presented with the *Permission error*&#xd;
&#xd;
Per below article, If you choose to use custom permission schemes, which are different from the mandatory permissions for the project roles in the typical service desk context then we will be presented with the Jira Service Management permission errors.&#xd;
 * [Customize Jira Service Management permissions|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/customize-jira-service-management-permissions/]&#xd;
&#xd;
This article lists the mandatory permissions for Service Desk Customers and below is the snippet for your quick reference:&#xd;
||Service Desk Customers|The permissions for customers must be granted to the *Service Desk Customer - Portal Access* security type, not the *Service Desk Customers* role. The Portal Access security type lets customers access the customer portal, but not Jira. The security type reads the role to determine who are customers. * Create Issues (Customers can create requests and view requests they have submitted via the customer portal)&#xd;
 * Browse Projects (Customers can access the project in the customer portal)&#xd;
 * Add Comments (Customers can comment on their requests.)&#xd;
 * Create Attachments (Customers can add attachments to their requests)&#xd;
 * Assign Issue (This permission is mandatory for the *Assignee* field to work. The *Assignee* field is an optional hidden field and it automatically channels issues to certain team members.)|&#xd;
&#xd;
However, we see that Assign/Delete permission is not mandatory and we should not have got the error. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We are presented with the *Permission error* below:&#xd;
!image-2022-02-01-19-15-24-029.png|width=549,height=251!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
We can just ignore this error and continue as currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.</description><createDate>2022-02-01T14:00:49.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - February 1, 2023|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
*Cloud Jira Service Management* is connected to a *Confluence Server* instance, where the Confluence Server instance is hosted on a Base URL with a context path (e.g. https://myconfluence.server.com/wiki).&#xd;
&#xd;
When attempting to connect the Cloud JSM Project to a *Knowledge base* from the Confluence Server instance, the testing of a valid [Authenticate portal user|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/authenticate-portal-users-to-access-knowledge-base-articles] fails with *{color:red}Credentials are invalid{color}.*&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Setup a *Confluence Server* instance with a Base URL that has a context path (e.g. https://myconfluence.server.com/wiki)&#xd;
#* Create a new user called *testuser* with any password of your choice&#xd;

&#xd;
We have a setup described in this issue: JSM Could linked to Confluence Server, which has Base URL with a context path, and a space from the Confluence Server instance is linked to the JSM Cloud project as a knowledge base.&#xd;
&#xd;
The only place we can see Confluence articles in JSM is the project knowledge base section https://&lt;domain>.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/&lt;projetcKey>/knowledge/articles .&#xd;
&#xd;
However, in the issue view (https://&lt;domain>.atlassian.net/browse/&lt;issueKey>) the "knowledge base" section in "details" shows "(!) We couldn’t load your articles" and knowledge base does not appear on the portal, much like described in issue https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5621&#xd;
&#xd;
In browser console there is a message "Fetch failed loading: GET https://&lt;domain>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedesk/knowledgebase/latest/articles/&lt;issueKey> ", navigating to this url returns error 400 "Service not found in the knowledge base server."&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When an Insight field has its filter issue scope setting configured with ${reporter}, this field does not return any objects for some customers in the customer portal.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to your Service Desk project - Project settings > People&#xd;
 # Invite an user as a Service Desk Customer from there&#xd;
 # Create an Insight object with Jira User attribute. e.g. Owner&#xd;
 # Assign the user invited in step 2 to the Owner attribute of the object&#xd;
 # Set up an Insight custom field with this query in filter issue scope field: {{"Owner" == ${reporter.label}}}&#xd;
 # Log in as the user in step 2&#xd;
 # Try to use the Insight field in customer portal&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:* For customers invited via the Customers page, they can successfully select the object where they are the Owner of in the customer portal.&#xd;
*Note:* this issue happens for project due to the same root cause (lack of reporter and project info being passed for the filter query)&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We expect at least 1 object to be returned and displayed as an option in the Insight field.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no results displayed in the Insight field.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Users that exist only in the customer role should still be able to create requests via the REST API.  Trying to reproduce this today by following the documentation in [POST /rest/servicedeskapi/request|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-rest-servicedeskapi-request-post] I find this is not possible to do.  It appears that this endpoint is only working for users in the Agent role.  But the existing docs do not make it clear that being an agent is required here. (I understand it is required to be an Agent to use the RaiseOnBehalfOf parameter, but I'm not trying to use that one in this case).&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a classic Jira Service Desk project&#xd;
# Invite a customer to join that service desk (that is not currently in your Jira site)&#xd;
# Have the customer login to the customer portal successfully at least once to make sure it works and they can see the request types there&#xd;
# As a customer, create a REST API token for yourself as per [Basic auth for REST APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/]&#xd;
# Try as a customer to create a request in that portal via the REST API using basic auth, this example uses curl {code:borderStyle=solid}&#xd;
curl --request POST \&#xd;
  --url 'https://[redacted].atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request' \&#xd;
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \&#xd;
  --header 'Authorization: Basic [redacted]' \&#xd;
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \&#xd;
  --data '{&#xd;
  "serviceDeskId": "2",&#xd;
  "requestTypeId": "17",&#xd;
  "requestFieldValues": {&#xd;
    "summary": "Request JSD help via REST",&#xd;
    "description": "Example description"&#xd;
  }&#xd;
}' &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Request is created successfully with the customer that is making this request as the reporter.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
curl command returns result of &#xd;
{code:borderStyle=solid}&#xd;
{"errorMessage":"You don't have permission to access this Service Desk.","i18nErrorMessage":{"i18nKey":"sd.agent.servicedesk.error.project.nopermission","parameters":[]} &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
From reading the documentation on this, it is not clear that a customer would be unable to perform this action.  &#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
This works if the user is an Agent, but that work-around is not viable in all use cases.</description><createDate>2020-03-18T22:08:53.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hello, Basic or OAuth authentication fail to connect to Jira Service Management with role 'Customer' (Error 401).&#xd;
&#xd;
Is there a solution for a Customer to use the Jira REST API to access requests - other than creating an 'Agent' role for a client, as we are not allowed to grant internal access to Customer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Or is it by design that 'Customer' has no access to Jira REST API.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In the issue REST API (/rest/api/3/issue/\{issueIdOrKey}), the name for the "issuetype" field is returned as "Issue Type" for next-gen JSD projects when it should be "Request Type". In our native apps, we display the field name in our Issue screen and showing an "Issue Type" can be confusing/misleading.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Find or create an issue in a next-gen JSD project&#xd;
 # Fetch the issue via the issue REST API (/rest/api/3/issue/\{issueIdOrKey})&#xd;
 # Inspect the JSON&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The name for the "issuetype" field is "Request Type"&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The name for the "issuetype" field is "Issue Type"&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
"editmeta": {&#xd;
    "fields": {&#xd;
[...]&#xd;
      "issuetype": {&#xd;
        "required": false,&#xd;
        "schema": {&#xd;
          "type": "issuetype",&#xd;
          "system": "issuetype"&#xd;
        },&#xd;
        "name": "Issue Type",&#xd;
        "key": "issuetype",&#xd;
[...]{noformat}&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
We could rename the field name client-side but that would require the same change in all clients and can lead to localisation mismatches.</description><createDate>2019-11-11T07:39:02.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi [~sstiefel],&#xd;
&#xd;
In Next-gen projects, issue types and request types have actually been combined into a single entity. This means that issue type name and request type name are the same thing - or put differently, the request type name IS the issue type name. Therefore this is expected behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'd like to close this off as not a bug, however please confirm this makes sense and that I've understood the bug report properly.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cheers,&#xd;
&#xd;
Oliver</text><author>oli</author></comments><comments><text>Thanks [~owessels] for the explanation!&#xd;
&#xd;
Your comment above makes sense. However, I am still a bit confused about the name of this new issue type/request type *field.* To customers, is it still exposed as an "Issue type" or should it be called "Request type"?&#xd;
&#xd;
At the moment, the *field name* is returned as "Issue Type" from the endpoint (see screen shot below). If that's correct, then there is no bug and this issue can be closed.&#xd;
&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2019-11-12 at 4.53.29 pm.png|thumbnail!</text><author>Simon Stiefel</author></comments><comments><text>That's a good point [~sstiefel] - there is a little bit of a mix of the naming between the UI and the API, which would be good to clarify. I've had a chat to the team and asked them to add a reply to this ticket to indicate the outcome.</text><author>oli</author></comments><comments><text>Hey [~sstiefel],&#xd;
&#xd;
Let me see if I can clarify that for you! As [~owessels] mentioned above, in next-gen we combined issue types and request types. In terms of fields, perhaps the more correct way to think about it is we removed the "Request Types" field completely (in classic this was the `vp_origin` custom field) and put all the portal functionality for request types into the new issue types UI.&#xd;
&#xd;
So it's expected that the field returned is called "issue type". In the web UI we have special logic to change this text to "Request types" in the navigation (and the field name doesn't appear in the new issue view) based on the project type. &#xd;
&#xd;
Our initial comms that went out can be found here if this still doesn't make sense: [https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/developing-for-jira-service-desk-cloud-next-gen-projects/]&#xd;
&#xd;
Hope that helps!</text><author>Ben Wong</author></comments><comments><text>Hi [~owessels] and [~bewong],&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks for the detailed clarification! That makes sense now. I have filed a ticket with our team to change the name of the field in the mobile UI to "Request type" if we're in a JSD next-gen project.&#xd;

Incomplete Portal translation&#xd;
Fields like *Raise this request on behalf of*, *What can we help you with?* are not translated to the default project Language set on the project.&#xd;
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to replicate:&#xd;
* Go to the Project Settings of the JSD project&#xd;
* Language Support&#xd;
* Select a Language other than English as the Default Language.&#xd;
* Access the Customer Portal for the project.&#xd;
* Try creating the issue &#xd;
* Observe that most of the fields are not translated.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected result&#xd;
The fields like *Raise this request on behalf of*,  *What can we help you with?*  are also translated.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Current result&#xd;
The fields like *Raise this request on behalf of*,  *What can we help you with?*  are not translated.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Ask the user to set the user's preferred language to the required Language.&#xd;
This will translate the whole Portal accordingly.</description><createDate>2019-08-11T15:26:06.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I have a variation of this where I only have one language active for Jira Service Desk (Danish) where parts of the interface is not translated.&#xd;

They are not translated either when only one language active (Dutch); with both the helpdesk and Jira default language set.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
File drag and drop in the customer portal sometimes freeze the screen, only being possible to exit by refreshing the page, which makes the customer lose all inputs entered in the request fields.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to the Customer Portal.&#xd;
 # Select a Request type that contains the Attachments field.&#xd;
 # Drag a file from your computer and drop anywhere.&#xd;
 !print2.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Observe that the file is successfully attached to the ticket but the screen gets blocked, not being possible to edit fields or submit the request.&#xd;
 !print.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The file is uploaded successfully and the page doesn't freeze.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The file is uploaded successfully and the page freeze.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
_Dated: 21/Jun/2019 2:06 PM_&#xd;
&#xd;
The CSS element {{*.cp-portal-dropzone.dropzone-active*}} is what blocks the screen.&#xd;
Unticking the *visibility* checkbox in Chrome DevTools unblocks the screen, solving the error.&#xd;
&#xd;
!print3.png|thumbnail!&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
Currently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;

&#xd;
Creating a "Due Date" hidden field for a Request Type in a Service Desk project while the system language being "German" will lead to customers unable to create requests via the portal. The customer will hit into the "This form contains a hidden field that does not have a valid default value configured" error.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to Reproduce*&#xd;
 # Go to General Configuration&#xd;
 # Change Indexing Language to _German_&#xd;
 # Change Default Language to _Deutsch (Deutschland)_&#xd;
 # Change Default user time zone to _Europe_ and Timezone to _(GMT+01:00) Berlin_&#xd;
 # Go to the Service Desk project > Request Type > set "Due Date" as a hidden field &#xd;
 # Change the date picker field (e. g Due Date) to any date in December (e.g 4/Dez/32 10:00 PM)&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
*Expected Results*&#xd;
&#xd;
- JIRA should be able to recognize "Dez" abbreviation for December&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Actual Results*&#xd;
&#xd;
 !error1.PNG|thumbnail! &#xd;
 &#xd;
*Note*&#xd;
If the same hidden field is viewed from a English profile in the instance it will show the following:&#xd;
&#xd;
 !error2.PNG|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
It will look correct in one language profile and show an error in another, the same goes for the Customer Portal, depending on which language: &#xd;
&#xd;
- If the system is set to German, the date will be set to 2/Dez/29, the English profile customers will not be able to create tickets. Because Jira is expecting the input to be 2/Dec/29&#xd;
- If the language profile is switched to English and the due date is set to 2/Dec/29, the German profile customers will not be able to create tickets. Because Jira is expecting the input to be 2/Dez/29&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround 1*&#xd;
&#xd;
Change the due date to a month which is both acceptable in English and German, such as 4/Nov/20, the value "Nov" is accepted in both languages. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround 2:*&#xd;
&#xd;
From within JIRA, change the date format from 02/Dez/29 to 02.12.29.  &#xd;
&#xd;
# Navigate to *General Configurations* > click on "Advanced Settings":&#xd;
&#xd;
Update your settings so that they match what is shown below:&#xd;
# *jira.date.picker.javascript.format=%d.%m.%y*&#xd;
# *jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format=%d.%m.%y %H:%M*&#xd;
# *jira.date.time.picker.java.format=d.MM.yy H:mm*&#xd;
# *jira.date.picker.java.format=d.MM.yy*&#xd;

&#xd;
It also happens in Jira Server.  Is there any plan for this bug?&#xd;
&#xd;
We are present in different countries and languages and it is a big issue for us. Date format with month as MMM is perfect to us to avoid issues with numeric date formats... 10/9/2019 is September 10th or October 9th?&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround we use is to set this default date as post function, using JWT where it is possible to use numeric date format&#xd;

&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Today one person came to me reporting this bug. He is using Jira in Finnish language and the problem occurs. The date picker picks the date e.g. 10th of October in following format:&#xd;
&#xd;
26/Loka/20&#xd;
&#xd;
But the correct and accepted format is:&#xd;
&#xd;
26/Lokakuuta/20&#xd;
&#xd;
If I type the "kuuta" to the end of the month name then Jira accepts the entered date. Please fix this asap!&#xd;

Use "jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format" and date picker "jira.date.picker.javascript.format" to change the format. This can be found under Jira Settings -> General Config -> Advanced settings. See  [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/changing-the-due-date-input-format-192536.html] to see how you can configure that date formats.&#xd;

 * Goto 'System' settings&#xd;
 * Goto 'General configuration'&#xd;

Once there you can change the format of the date time picker under "jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format" and date picker "jira.date.picker.javascript.format" (See attached image ). These follow linux formatting standards for display dates. </text><author>kohlerfc</author></comments><comments><text>Hi @Chris Kohler, @Enida Zhapa,&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using the current/"old" help center in either Dutch or German, the date/time picker on the request form doesn't allow the customer to conveniently pick a time.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 * JSD Cloud&#xd;
 * "Old"/current help center&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Place a date/time picker in a request/portal form&#xd;
 # Navigate to the portal&#xd;
 # Try to set a date/time value&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * The customer is able to select a time and set a date/time value&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * Challenging for customers to pick a time&#xd;
 * The mouse pointer is over the "Hour" picker:&#xd;
 !Jan-03-2019 11-34-15.gif!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
 * The tool-tip is longer than the width of the date picker, so the picker "flickers"&#xd;
 * Seems to affect the portal when the language is set to Dutch or German&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Slowly move the mouse pointer to the right of the picker as shown in this video: [^date_time_picker.mov]&#xd;
 * Use the [new help center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2018/12/our-new-help-center-is-ready-for-your-customers-to-experience](instructions in the linked blog post).

Summary&#xd;
 * When the date format is changed in Jira({{https://&lt;instance_name>.atlassian.net/secure/admin/AdvancedApplicationProperties.jspa}}), the date picker field in the "new help center" should conform to the settings defined in Jira&#xd;
 * Currently, when the date format has been changed e.g. {{dd.MM.yyy}} instead of the default {{d/MMM/yy}} format, the dates are either displayed incorrectly(dates in the future) or a false error message is thrown(dates in the past)&#xd;
 * This issue doesn't occur in the old help center&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Jira Service Desk&#xd;
 * "new help center" enabled&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Define the date format in Jira settings > System > General settings; Advanced Settings({{https://&lt;instance_name>.atlassian.net/secure/admin/AdvancedApplicationProperties.jspa}}). For demonstration purposes, we are using {{dd.MM.yyyy}}:&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When exporting an issue to Word format(either from Issue Navigator or directly on the issue), the values for the "Organizations" and "Request Participants" fields are not displayed in the resulting .doc file.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 * JSD Cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a test issue where a reporter&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * In the .doc file, the correct values for the "Organizations" and the "Request Participants" fields are shown&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * This is an export of an issue where the "Organizations" and "Request Participants" fields have a value set:&#xd;
 !Screen Shot 2018-08-22 at 11.59.36 AM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
 * As long as the "Organizations" field or "Request Participants" field has a value set, the exported .doc file will not have the values shown as _blank_.&#xd;
 * This bug applies to portal, email or JSD originated issues&#xd;
 * The behaviour when the "Organizations" and "Request Participants" fields don't have a value set is correct, the field values are displayed as "None"&#xd;
 !Screen Shot 2018-08-22 at 11.59.42 AM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * It's possible to create custom fields and create a [workflow post function|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/advanced-workflow-configuration-776636620.html#Advancedworkflowconfiguration-postfunctions] to copy the field values on transition and have the data displayed in the custom field instead of the original fields&#xd;
* The post functions can be added to as many transitions within a workflow as required&#xd;
* For "Request Participants", a "User Picker (multiple users)" custom field can be used&#xd;
* For "Organizations", a "Text Field (multi-line)" custom field can be used&#xd;
*  Example custom fields:&#xd;

&#xd;
 When SLA *Goals* JQL are set with the Organization field it can lead to irregular results based on how the quotes are utilized. The irregular results would usually lead to the SLA not being applied on an issue key even though the JQL gives the green tick on the SLA being configured. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to Reproduce*&#xd;
 # Go to the SLA page of the Service Desk Project&#xd;
 # Create a new SLA and name it&#xd;
 # Set an easy *Start* condition such as: *Issue Created*, the *Pause* and *Stop* conditions can be anything.&#xd;
 # In the *Goal* section start creating a JQL such as the following: &#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&#xd;
Organizations = "Test" {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # The JQL will prompt you a "green tick" indicating the JQL is valid and you can *Update* and click on *Save* to apply the JQL&#xd;
 # Create an issue to the Service Desk portal and ensure this customer is apart of the Organization Test. &#xd;
 # When the ticket is created the *Goal* will not be applied to the newly created ticket despite meeting the conditions. &#xd;
&#xd;
  &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Expected Results*&#xd;
&#xd;
The *JQL* set in the Goal's JQL should be applied to the ticket that meets the condition for the *Organizations*. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Actual Results*&#xd;
&#xd;
The *JQL* set in the Goal's JQL does not apply to the ticket that meets the condition for the *Organizations*. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround:*&#xd;
Despite giving you the "green tick" which indicates that the JQL is correct it in fact does not process the JQL that you have configured, there are a number of rules with the quote. &#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario A: Organization Only JQL* &#xd;
&#xd;
**If the JQL only contains the Organization, remove the quotes and it will work. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
 Organizations = Test {code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario B: Organization and Other Conditions JQL Version 1*&#xd;
&#xd;
**If the JQL only contains the *Organization* and another condition, in this case if the *Organization* has quotes, ensure the second condition also has quotes, this applies to the third and so on condition, all of it must have quotes to work:&#xd;
&#xd;
SUCCESS: &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Organizations = "Test" AND priority = "High"{code}&#xd;
 FAILURE:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Organizations = "Test" AND priority = High{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario C: Organization and Other Conditions JQL Version 2*&#xd;
&#xd;
**If the JQL only contains the *Organization* and another condition, in this case if the *Organization* does not have quotes, the second condition does not have to remove quotes, this applies to the third and so on condition:&#xd;
&#xd;
SUCCESS: &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Organizations = Test AND priority = High{code}&#xd;
 SUCCESS:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Organizations = Test AND priority = "High"{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:*&#xd;
&#xd;
**This issue does not occur with *Issue Navigator*, regardless of quote or no quote, the search result is accurate, only replicated so far in the SLA *Goal* JQL column. &#xd;

Feature or Bug?</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-5942</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5942</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
When a user clicks on a Related article within the Service Desk KB view, a new tab is opened. If we click on the same link within Confluence view then it opens the link in the same tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Open a Service Desk KB article.&#xd;
# Click on a related article, it opens in a new tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Should it show as a new tab or on the same tab?&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Links open in a new tab.</description><createDate>2018-02-13T01:01:00.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is intended behaviour, we always open in a new tab when a user clicks on a link in a KB article when viewing from Service Desk.&#xd;
&#xd;
There is currently no way to override this behaviour.&#xd;
&#xd;
This behaviour exists mostly for legacy reasons, there's no plans to change this behaviour in the near future.&#xd;
&#xd;
Going to mark this issue as 'Done' for now, we can re-assess if more customers ask for this.</text><author>chao</author></comments><comments><text>Please consider providing a choice.&#xd;
&#xd;
Giving us no ability to change how a hyperlink opens for our front-facing KB articles should be reconsidered.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, we prefer a decision-based, step-by-step, multi-page troubleshooter. It does not work right when each page opens in new tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
We would appreciate the consideration.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Paul Petrin</author></comments><comments><text>Agreed. Showing the pages in Service Desk works well. Opening links in a new tab is jarring</text><author>Robert O'Regan</author></comments><comments><text>It's actually the /remotepageview endpoint of Confluence that injects a &lt;base> attribute into the DOM. We would like to use that endpoint to integrate Confluence pages into our app. Unfortunately, the "always opens in new tab" is unacceptable for our use case. Seems like we'll have to implement our own remotepageview endpoint now.&#xd;
&#xd;
It would be awesome if Atlassian folks could add a query parameter that turns this behaviour off. If the query parameter is optional, then you won't even need to touch existing client code ...</text><author>Alexander Weickmann</author></comments><comments><text>Thinking this over for another day, we came to the conclusion that the current behavior is not so bad at all. In the sense of "it's a feature, not a bug".&#xd;
&#xd;
If the links would open within the iframe:&#xd;
 * The entire Confluence layout would be shown. To embed the Confluence page, service desk calls the special /remotepageview endpoint from Confluence. However, any links on that page still point to the normal page view, and thus will have the full layout&#xd;
 * You could open external links as well. This would completely break the Service Desk context.&#xd;
 * The navigation with the embedded content does not have browser back and forward buttons</text><author>Alexander Weickmann</author></comments><comments><text>I would also like this issue to be fixed and for Atlassian to reconsider changing this. It is not user friendly at all.&#xd;
&#xd;
At the very least, even if you have to open a new tab, the navigation "crumb" menu should not reset.&#xd;
&#xd;
Example: I open service desk (Help Center), click on my service desk product (Service Desk 2), click on user guides (Service Desk 2 User Guides), then choose a user guide (User Guide 1), then choose an article (How to log in)&#xd;
&#xd;
When on the "User guide 1" page, the top bar would show: Help Center / Service Desk 2 / Service Desk 2 User Guides / User Guide 1&#xd;
&#xd;
When on the "How to log in page", the top bar only shows: Help Center / Service Desk 2 / How to log in&#xd;
&#xd;
These "breadcrumbs" should represent the actual page order, regardless of the fact that the article was opened in a new tab in order for the customer to easier find their way back to the previous page.</text><author>Alexandra Bobrow (Instech)</author></comments><comments><text>Please fix this so that it behaves like Confluence pages, in the least. Better yet, add the option to choose whether links open in the same tab or another tab. Having help center pages open in a new tab by default is a poor experience since customers do not expect that to happen within the same environment.&#xd;
&#xd;
My request is for all the ways we can link to other pages:&#xd;
* regular hyperlinks on text&#xd;
* content by label macro&#xd;
* children display macro&#xd;
* other macros with page links...</text><author>Laura Sands</author></comments><comments><text>We agree with Laura. Users of the helpdesk are lost when they read 10 articles!</text><author>Arjan van Duivenboden</author></comments><comments><text>We have a guide with links to the "next step" or "previous step" that would work much better if the links opened in the same tab. Please add support for this. &#xd;
&#xd;
You mentioned "we can re-assess if more customers ask for this."&#xd;
&#xd;
How many more customer requests for this feature do you need before you re-assess? </text><author>Gammy Pichardo</author></comments><comments><text>We are running into accessibility issues with this, too. By default, we want all pages to open in the same tab so we don't have to add disclaimers each time something is going to open in a new tab. </text><author>Cassandra Rinker</author></comments><comments><text>Please dont ignore this issue and fix! Customers starting to ask us whether JSD is a finished product or if they are beta testing... Quite disappointing.</text><author>Thomas</author></comments><comments><text>We are not exited with this behaviour as well.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please implement the standard functionality for links: Click > same tab, &lt;CTRL> Click > new tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks</text><author>mathias.friederich</author></comments><comments><text>This is an accessibility issue. Recommendations are for articles to not open in new tabs. Please re-open and resolve this functionality error. </text><author>Sarah Fischer</author></comments><comments><text>Is anyone at Atlassian reading these comments? As with a lot of the changes you guys make, it seems like you do whatever you want regardless of customer feedback. </text><author>Gammy Pichardo</author></comments><comments><text>Spoiler: They aren't.</text><author>Thomas</author></comments><comments><text>Please re-open the issue. This is a big problem for us here at Mercedes-Benz HQ as well. This could possibly be a show-stopper for our Confluence implementation for our IAM internal and user documentation. Much appreciated! </text><author>christopher.mensah-bonsu</author></comments><comments><text>This "feature" actually has an unintended consequence which I have not seen reported anywhere else. When a KB article opens in a new tab, the breadcrumb gets built on the fly, and the previous crumb is broken. This ONLY happens when you open an article in a new tab. &#xd;
&#xd;
1. open an article in a new tab&#xd;
&#xd;
2. click the previous crumb to go back one level&#xd;

Have you taken a look at ServiceNow? They have a better KB integration than Atlassian Jira with Confluence. The only problem for me was that the company that used the ServiceNow didn't organize them very well. But if you organize them well initially, it would be a good alternative product.&#xd;
&#xd;
I don't think a lot will happen in this bug report anymore because prio is low and it has been open since 2018… Some tickets here are more than 10 years old without resolution or they just get closed without any solution.&#xd;

&#xd;
As a PM for our company, we are adopting Service Management for our support portal and the current behavior greatly limits the UX for our customers. Just browsing a knowledge base opens many tabs, which is not expected, and requires the non-experienced user to manually close each tab, or a more experienced browser might know how to close all tabs to the right, but that takes awareness of where the first tab is in the ribbon.&#xd;
&#xd;
Website best practices and customer expectations are that links within a site should default to reusing the current tab, and users can use common browser features to force a link to display in a new tab or new window, and site developers should be allowed to control the UX for individual links to force a link, typically external to site, to open in a new tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although this issue is listed as minor, it does immediately undermine the users' experience and their impression on the company that is using the Service Management service. Every user is impacted by this non-ideal UX. Sure a user can just close tabs, but every user has to do it.</text><author>Scott Richardson</author></comments><comments><text>[~7d648cc8d2ed] I agree this is as basic as it gets, I wouldn't hold your breath though, this has been open for almost six years now....</text><author>Derek Hixon</author></comments><comments><text>I second Scott Richardsons comment; can someone from Jira Service Management please comment on this issue and enlighten us as to why it has seemingly not been looked into for over 6-7 years? &#xd;

Logo not showing in customer portal after refreshing the page.&#xd;

h3.Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Project settings;&#xd;
# Portal settings;&#xd;
# Click on *View and customize* (or access "View and customize" from the Help Centre /servicedesk/customer/portals page)&#xd;
# Upload a new logo and save&#xd;

h3.Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Logo is displayed without refreshing the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Logo is not showing and the Help Centre name shows up instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
Refresh the page or navigate away to display the configured logo.&#xd;

# when I upload the new logo it gets previewed correctly (logo change from the customise panel is not saved yet)&#xd;
# when I save the changes, the logo doesn't show up and the text is then displayed (the url is then: https://xxxxxxxx.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals?no-redirect=true)&#xd;
# if I refresh or navigate any other url from tha point the logo then displays fine and I don't hit the problem any more&#xd;
&#xd;
Can you confirm that the problem is in step #2 after saving the logo change and that after navigating or refreshing then the logo has no problem rendering?&#xd;
&#xd;
EDIT: we checked a little more and it appears that clearing your cache when loading a page also gets the logo to not show up from time to time (e.g. use case of "first time loading the image without having it cached in the browser" type of caching issue).

Summary&#xd;
When an issue type is changed on a ticket, it will break the request type mapping and the request type field will be displayed as _No match_. However, if the ticket is viewed in the issue navigator list view, the request type field shows the previous request type value so searching for request type null/empty would not return a value.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a ticket via the customer portal. Make sure the request type is valid.&#xd;
# Change the issue type of the ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The request type shows no match and the field is empty in the issue navigator list view.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The request type shows no match and the field shows the previous value in the issue navigator list view.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;

&#xd;
For all of you that are being affected by this, here it goes a possible workaround:&#xd;
 # Create a new automation rule (not legacy automation)&#xd;
 # The best trigger for this is the *Field value changed*:&#xd;
 ** *Fields to monitor for changes*: Issue Type&#xd;
 ** *For*: Edit Issue (Transition issue can be added here too)&#xd;
 # For action, pick *Edit Issue* action&#xd;
 ** Select *More Options* and paste the JSON below:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:json}&#xd;
{&#xd;
    "fields": {&#xd;
        "Request Type": null&#xd;
    }&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
That's it! This should be enough to free you from this bug. :D&#xd;
&#xd;
Here are a few considerations:&#xd;
 # This rule can be created under the *Scope* of *Single Project*&#xd;
 # In some sites, this field is called *Customer Request Type* instead of *Request Type*, this should reflect in the *JSON* too.</text><author>Yuri Moura</author></comments><comments><text>@Yuri - You'll need to make a small correction. See below:&#xd;

This is Rachel Crossman from the Jira Service Management Product Management team. Thank you for your patience as we work on investigating this bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
Looking into this, we've identified complexity in the potential solutions, as there could be unintended flow-on impacts to other areas of the product experience related to request types. We're continuing to investigate safe resolutions, and we will update here again in the new year as we dive deeper into the options.&#xd;

 </text><author>Rachel Crossman</author></comments><comments><text>Hi everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
This is Rachel Crossman from the Jira Service Management Product Management team. Thank you for your patience as we've looked into this bug. &#xd;
&#xd;
On further investigation, we have found that the original Request Type is still associated with the Issue (in the database), but that the Issue Type &amp; Request Type are not connected in that project, and are an "invalid" pairing. Because they are an invalid pairing, it is causing some inconsistencies in what is shown across different product experiences (Issue View &amp; Portal; vs Issue Navigator and Queues). &#xd;
&#xd;
To resolve this inconsistency, we will be updating the Issue View and Portal Views to show the _original_ Request Type, so it will match what is shown in the Issue Navigator, Queues and other JQL-based experiences. We will be including some UI prompts on Issue View to indicate that the Request Type is Invalid and that it needs to be updated. We have decided to do this, rather than hide the Request Type in the JQL-based experiences as suggested on this bug, as it is true to the real state of the database. &#xd;
&#xd;
I will provide an update here again soon, with a timeline for the resolution. &#xd;
&#xd;
We are looking now into solutions to the root cause of this problem, and how we can better prevent this Invalid state from occurring, as well as more ways to alert and surface any Issues that are in this state. &#xd;
&#xd;
If you have any questions, comments, or feedback about this issue and our proposed solution, please do reach out here and I'd be happy to book in time to chat!&#xd;
&#xd;
Kind regards,&#xd;
&#xd;

 </text><author>Rachel Crossman</author></comments><comments><text>Hi everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you again for your feedback. We have now fixed this issue, and will be closing this bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
As the original Request Type is still stored on the Issue (despite the Issue Type and Request Type not matching), we have changed the behaviour so that the original Request Type will now show on the Issue View (as it does in Filters &amp; Queues).&#xd;
&#xd;
On Issue View, we have highlighted that the Request Type is Invalid so that users can select a valid Request Type for that Issue Type - this will then update the Request Type value on the Issue, and the new value will show in all views (Queues, Issue View, etc).&#xd;
&#xd;
We have identified that the Move Issue/Change Issue Type experiences are the most common cause for Issues ending up in this state, and are looking into this as a separate item of work. Please follow [Update request type upon issue type change|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1835] for further updates.&#xd;

&#xd;
When a customer tries to search for a custom query within the *Request* option of the customer portal of an instance, the results shown per page changes as you move from one page to another without any consistency. If there is no query entered in the search bar, the results displayed are correct and as you navigate from one page result to the next there is no issue, the issue per page count is correct. This is only apparent when a custom query is entered within the search functionality of the *Requests* portion of the customer portal. In some cases, it displays that there are a total of 4 pages of issue count to navigate but if you click on Page 2 of Page 4 all of a sudden it decreases to 3 pages only instead maintaining the initially seen 4 pages to navigate.&#xd;
&#xd;
Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open any customer portal access page > Click on the top corner *Requests* > Choose *All Requests*/ *Organization*/*My Request (as long as the issue count displayed per page is more than 1 page)&#xd;
 # In the search field (Request contains...) > search any query that will produce a result with more than 1 page of content.&#xd;
 # The results will be filtered based on the custom query > Scroll down and note the page number and the issue count per page&#xd;
!Page_1.png|width=489,height=638!&#xd;
&#xd;
 - Example: Page 1 (1-20 of 27)&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Click on the Page 2 and notice the change in the issue count and the page number&#xd;
!Page_2.png|width=691,height=424!&#xd;
&#xd;
 - Example: Page 2 (21-27 of 7) , the page navigation can disappear as well depending on the total issue count that is filtered from the query&#xd;
&#xd;
Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
To be able to navigate through the pages and view the filtered issue based on the custom query properly.&#xd;
&#xd;
Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Filtered issue based on custom query changes from page to page without consistency and is hard to actually check and navigate through the issues in a proper manner.</description><createDate>2017-09-08T15:53:17.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Users unable to see issues with security level configured in Service Desk Customer Portal</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-5585</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5585</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

When you add the option "Service Desk Customer - Portal Access" to an *Issue Security Level*, it is not allowing service desk Customer to view issues.&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In a Service Desk project, add a default security issue level to all your newly created issues&#xd;
 # Add the Field Security Level to your Service Desk Screens and to the request types to properly configure the security level to all issues created on the customer portal&#xd;
 # Add the option "Service Desk Customer - Portal Access" to the default Issue Security level&#xd;
 # As a customer, create a new issue and navigate to *All requests*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user should be able to see his own request.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The number of requests is properly displayed on the customer portal, however, the user is not able to see his own request or get notifications about any updates on his ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
# The same issue occur when using "Reporter" and possibly other JIRA fields&#xd;
# If a request has Issue security with option "Service Desk Customer - Portal Access", automation with the option "User who triggered the rule" will also not run. Using *Service Desk Customers* allows the automation to run.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Add the Customer users in a different way to the *issue security level*. e.g: project role *Service Desk Customers*.&#xd;

This is still not working.Can you please suggest me.</text><author>Harvesh Kumar</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,&#xd;
it´s still not working. Your Workaround ist not the best way, because we need only Service Desk Customer - Portal Access in the security level. If uers are in project role Service Desk Customers, they will see issues with this security level in Service Desk and in Customer Portal.&#xd;
Will this problem be solved?&#xd;
&#xd;
Many Thanks</text><author>przemyslaw.wesolka729326708</author></comments><comments><text>Hello [~Przemyslaw.Wesolka729326708],&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
* When trying to reset a customer password via the JIRA Service Desk Project > Customers tab, the JIRA Service Desk administrator is directed to User Management e.g. https://{{INSTANCE_NAME}}.atlassian.net/admin/users/view?username={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL_ADDRESS}}.&#xd;
* Password reset email is sent, but the URL in the password reset link resets the customer's Atlassian ID password.&#xd;
* JIRA Service Desk customers do not authenticate using Atlassian ID.&#xd;
* The password reset feature has no effect on the JIRA Service Desk customer account - the password on a customer account(portal only) stays the same.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* JSD 1000.1313.0&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce.&#xd;
# Create new customer in JSD.&#xd;
# Customer accepts invitation sent via email.&#xd;
# Customer sets a "Display name" and password e.g. "Password123".&#xd;
# JIRA Service Desk admin resets customer password by hovering the mouse pointer over the customer account; More > Administer.  The JIRA Service Desk Admin is directed to User Management(https://{{INSTANCE_NAME}}.atlassian.net/admin/users/view?username={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL_ADDRESS}}).&#xd;
# Password email sent to customer.&#xd;
# If customer doesn't have an Atlassian ID, customer is prompted to sign up for an Atlassian ID.  If the customer has an Atlassian ID, then the customer is prompted to reset the Atlassian ID password.&#xd;
# After the customer sets a new password.&#xd;
# Customer tries to log into the Service Desk Portal with new credentials - login fails.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Password is reset and access to the Service Desk Portal is granted.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* Customer receives an error message: "Sorry, your email and password are incorrect - please try again."&#xd;
* Access is not granted.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
* Using the original password("Password123" in our example) that was set will allow the customer to log into the Service Desk Portal.  &#xd;
* The password reset feature has no effect on the JIRA Service Desk customer account.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
* Navigate to: https://{{INSTANCE_NAME}}.atlassian.net/admin/jira-service-desk/portal-only-customers/view?username={{USERNAME}} (in most cases the email address is the username) and update the customer's password from there</description><createDate>2017-05-23T13:13:25.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is the wrong link for portal only customers. The correct link to edit a portal only customer is https://{{INSTANCE_NAME}}.atlassian.net/admin/jira-service-desk/portal-only-customers/view?username=USERNAME (in most cases the email address is the username). That page allows to set a new password for customers. Please note that this type of user can only ever log in through INSTANCE_NAME.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal as going to INSTANCE_NAME.atlassian.net/ will redirect the user to the Atlassian Account login page which only allows Atlassian Account users to log in.&#xd;
&#xd;
We are currently in the process of enabling Atlassian Account on all sites (step 1) as well as a new Identity platform (step 2). Once step 1 is complete, portal only customers need to be managed in a separate section in Site Administration: JIRA Service Desk > Portal only customers. Until step 2 is complete, the existing user link still partially works (as noticed in this issue, reset password does not!). I suspect the customer reached the page due to JSDCLOUD-5322 as navigating in the site admin UI should never point a portal only customer to the old link.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
While the StatusPage add-on for JSD is enabled, the option inside of Service Desk to 'Raise a request' does not function properly. Clicking that button will open the overlay, but it will be empty and no customer information can be entered.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
JIRA Service Desk Cloud&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install the StatusPage for JSD add-on for Cloud ([https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jsd-status-page/cloud/overview])&#xd;
 # As an agent, go to queue view and choose *Raise a request* from the left hand navigation panel&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The customer portal overlay loads on top of the page and you are able to select a request.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The customer portal overlays loads but shows a blank page and there is no possibility to raise a request.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2017-01-26-20-20-53-719.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Accessing the portal URL in a separate browser window allows you to access the portal with no issues. &#xd;
&#xd;
If you strictly need to use *Raise a request* feature from inside the JSD project, then the only workaround is to disable the StatusPage add-on.</description><createDate>2017-01-26T19:07:51.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Navigating to portal as agent from queue view now works properly with Status Page app installed.</text><author>Gerry Tan</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Internal comment tab doesn't respond in pop-up windows</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-5184</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5184</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
When adding comments in pop-up windows in SD requests, the 'Internal comment's tab is not responding.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, if you have a Service Desk project which is shown in an Agile board, when viewing it in the Detail View in Backlog or Active Sprint pages, if you click to comment on it, the pop up page has an 'Internal Comment' tab that doesn't respond anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is also failing when transitioning the issue when it has comment in the transition screen. The pop-up window to transition has an 'Internal comment' tab that doesn't respond.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
The Internal comment functionality can also be accessed directly from the ticket. Navigate to the issue and add any internal comments there.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Replicated in these versions:&#xd;
* JIRA v7.2.0-OD-03-005&#xd;
* JIRA Service Desk v3.2.0-OD-04-003-D20160224T230516&#xd;
* JIRA Agile v7.2.2-D20160223T031242&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Scenario 1. When transitioning&#xd;
# Create a Service Desk project&#xd;
# Create a request in this project&#xd;
# Make sure you have a transition to the customer with comments (should be there by default as 'Respond to Customer')&#xd;
# Click the transition&#xd;
# Click the 'Internal comment' tab&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Scenario 2: In an Agile board&#xd;
# Create a Service Desk project&#xd;
# Create a board (either Scrum or Kanban) associated with this project (showing issues from it)&#xd;
# Make sure you have requests in the project&#xd;
# Go to the boards Backlog or Active Sprint page, where there is at least one issue&#xd;
# Click it to open its Detail View&#xd;
# In 'Comments' section, click the 'Comment' button&#xd;
#* A Comment pop-up window will appear&#xd;
# Click the 'Internal comment' tab&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
In both cases, the 'Internal comment' tab should be selected and this message should appear:&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Your comments will not be visible to customers on the portal.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The tab doesn't respond.&#xd;
&#xd;
No errors in logs, but this appears in JavaScript console when accessing the board:&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
This is a very recent bug, because I cannot replicate in these versions (which at the time that the affected version was release, some instances were still using):&#xd;
* JIRA v7.2.0-OD-02-009&#xd;
* JIRA Service Desk v3.2.0-OD-03-003-D20160217T060814&#xd;

&#xd;
There was a similar bug:&#xd;
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-2292&#xd;
&#xd;
But this current bug seems to start happening in a much earlier version. As I mentioned above, version JIRA SD v3.2.0-OD-03 was not affected and that other bug is for version 2.5.4.</description><createDate>2016-02-25T17:20:27.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This +bug+ significantly impacts my workflow efficiency.

&#xd;
# Create a new Service Desk request with new project&#xd;
# Remove all the groups from the people's tab&#xd;
# Remove all the groups from project role&#xd;
# Navigate to https://&lt;intstance name>/servicedesk/customer/portals&#xd;
# Notice the project created is visible in the portal&#xd;
# Issue can be still created&#xd;
&#xd;
Expected behavior, since the all users does not have permission to even browse the project, it should not allow the project to be viewable on the portal at the first place.&#xd;
&#xd;
Suspect: There are a new flag that allows customer to view the portal. Remove the flag seems to be fix the issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Workaround:&#xd;
Run the follow query:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
update "AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK" set "OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCESS" = null where "OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCESS" = 1;&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
This will unflag the *"OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCESS"* flag and it should be remain hidden for unintended group.&#xd;

When a request type group is deleted, the request types within that group should be hidden when searching in the portal. These are hidden from searching in the project's portal as expected, but not when searching in the shared customer portal.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new Service Desk project&#xd;
 # Delete the 'General' request type group, which should hide all of the request types in that group in the Customer Portal&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Customer Portal for that project&#xd;
 # Search for 'emp', notice that no results are found matching this request type and project&#xd;
 # Navigate to the shared portal Help Center&#xd;
 # Search for 'emp', notice that request types within the deleted group from the project are appearing, e.g. "Employee exit"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Request types from the group that was deleted should not appear in the shared portal Help Center search.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Request types that should be hidden are appearing in the search results.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Unable to invite a Customer to a Service Desk that is currently either an inactive user, or the user was removed from the instance and still is associated with a JIRA issue(reporter, assignee, or comment added).&#xd;
&#xd;
This is due to the user having already existed in JIRA and has association with a JIRA Issue, therefore JIRA is maintaining a copy of the user in its database.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* JIRA 7.1.0-OD-05-006&#xd;
* JIRA Service Desk 3.1.0-OD-12-001&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Add a user to JIRA&#xd;
# Create a JIRA Issue as the user, assign issue to user, or add comment as user&#xd;
# Delete the user from JIRA, or mark the user as inactive (both trigger the same results)&#xd;
# Try to invite the user to Service Desk Project as Customer&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
An error should be displayed with more accurate verbage regarding the issue, and provided documentation/direction on how to fix.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Receive vague/unhelpful error {color:red}*Could not invite some customers, user not found.*{color}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround if user has been removed entirely&#xd;
# Visit User Management on the instance (https://&lt;instance>.atlassian.net/admin/users)&#xd;
# Click Create User and re-create the user with the email address that failed the Service Desk customer invite.&#xd;
-- When creating the user, ensure that no application access is selected&#xd;
# After the User has been added, select *Restricted Portal* access&#xd;
# Proceed to the Service Desk and re-invite the Customer&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround if user has been deactivated&#xd;
# Check the inactive users in User Management (https://&lt;instance>.atlassian.net/admin/users?activeFilter=inactive)&#xd;
# Navigate to the user's User Management profile&#xd;
# Remove from any unwanted Groups/Applications&#xd;
# Re-activate user&#xd;
# Invite to Service Desk</description><createDate>2016-02-05T10:47:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi&#xd;

I'm thrilled that I was pointed to a workaround for this bug. We've been plagued by quite a few users that are mysteriously unable to access our Service Desk because of this. The workaround is fine for now, I hope you can get this fixed soon. &#xd;
&#xd;
Is there a way to identify all of my inactive users so I can restore their access all at once?&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks!</text><author>Spenser Rubin</author></comments><comments><text>This seems to be yet another situation where we are being told to grant someone Global Admin rights to work aound this issue.  The person who manages our serive desk does not have global rights and cannot perform the work around steps as outlined here.  Just as with the Start // Manage Sprint situation, you are now telling us to grant Global Admin rights or further burden the I.T. support staff with more tasks.&#xd;
&#xd;
Is there an ETA for when this issue will be resolved, as this is very disruptive to my team.  We would prefer that our client-facing Service Desk team manage this process, not the internal I.T. support team.</text><author>Sean McDonald</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Customer portal logo broken on IE11</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-5041</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-5041</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In JIRA Service Desk, IE11 will only render a custom logo on a customer portal if the image is in a .PNG format. .BMP, .JPG, .GIF logos will break in IE11(see screenshots). Chrome, Firefox and Safari will render the any of the mentioned image formats without issue.&#xd;

*Confluence Table of Contents macro is now supported on Jira Service Desk Cloud knowledge base *&#xd;
Hi all, just want to let you all know table of content macro is now supported on Jira Service Desk Cloud. Go try it out today!{panel}&#xd;
h3. &#xd;
&#xd;
Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Confluence KB Space is linked to a Service Desk project, the Table of Contents Macro is not displayed on any page containing the macro when viewing from the Customer Portal as a Customer.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Link a Confluence KB Space to a Service Desk Project&#xd;
 # Add a Table of Contents Macro to any page of the Space&#xd;
 # Visit the Customer Portal directly from the Portal URL&#xd;
 # Search for the page that contains the Table of Contents Macro&#xd;
 # Select the Page to view it&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The page loads in a modal window and should contain all content added to the page, including the Table of Contents Macro.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Table of Contents Macro is omitted from the page, and all other page content works as intended.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround we found is to use the Table of Contents Zone macro in the *New Confluence Editor* instead. Brief steps are as follows:&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Add *Table of Contents Zone* to the page.&#xd;
 2. Edit the macro and include the main body/text of the page is inside of the macro.&#xd;
 !Screen Shot 2019-12-06 at 10.56.37 AM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
3. Save the macro and publish the page.&#xd;
 !Screen Shot 2019-12-06 at 10.57.57 AM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
4. Go to the portal and search for this page.&#xd;
 5. The complete page shows up including the macro output.&#xd;

&#xd;
For a HELP DESK, what is more critical than presenting the KNOWLEDGE BASE docs accurately?  Our have tons of subjects and REQUIRE a TOC.&#xd;

&#xd;
From #52734 that is a later DUPLICATE of this.  The votes there should be *ADDED* to these, since you so enjoy Bug Roulette.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Ira (and others) - Not that it "fixes" the issue - the one "workaround" we are using (at the moment) includes:&#xd;
 * using the ToC macro for documents which we can add as a shortcut in our Help Desk &#xd;
 * creating a manual ToC using hyperlinks for documents which are needed/linked within issues&#xd;
&#xd;
Not ideal and not great and very annoying - but I thought I would share (and I do realize you mentioned having a significant number of documents and it may not work for you :)).  </text><author>Deleted Account</author></comments><comments><text>Karen, we ALWAYS appreciate a suggestion.  ANY suggestion.  That is the only workaround that we were able to figure out, also.&#xd;
&#xd;
It *COULD* be workable.  The challenge is the frequency of change of the rather complex docs.  Thanks to Confluence, everyone on our small dev or support teams edits the docs frequently.  Every week or so, we generate fresh PDFs and post them to our support site - currently Mantis BugTracker (highly modified).  Confluence works well for that purpose, especially with Numbered headings and TOC macros.  &#xd;
&#xd;
With frequent changes to the docs, every couple of days on average, deploying every week, the maintenance would be pretty time-consuming.&#xd;
&#xd;
The idea here was the our customers could use the LATEST version of the docs, and we did not have to formally "publish" them (necessarily) for download.  How foolish of us.&#xd;
&#xd;
*What is REALLY AGGRAVATING is that we don't seem to be able to DISABLE the BROKEN Search KnowledgeBase functionality.*  We would prefer to NOT present the doc results at this point.  If we REMOVE all the docs, the darned SEARCH bar REMAINS and the user gets NO DOCS FOUND (or whatever).  If we could DELETE the search bar, that would be the best workaround at this time.  I am sure there is a listed bug report for that too, since everything that needs to be changed is a "Pending Bug Report"...</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Hi, is there an ETA for this to be resolved?</text><author>Zaheer Haral</author></comments><comments><text>Zaheer, they use a stupid VOTING method to decide what to fix.  This has only 31 votes so they will continue to ignore this egregious problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
Vote for this and do not expect ANYTHING to happen.  This method of bug fixes is total BULLS#|T.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Why are we having to "vote" for this?  It's obvious functionality that is clearly broken, so why would you not just fix it instead of having dozens of frustrated users (aka paying customers) wait several years for a solution?&#xd;
&#xd;
Service Desk KB articles are created in Confluence.  Documents in Confluence can include built-in macro functions like the ToC and others.  Thus, the output of those macros should be visible to Service Desk users viewing the KB articles.  This seems obvious – why have a multi-year popularity contest about this?&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Marc Jensen</author></comments><comments><text>Marc Jensen, what the Heck do you think you are, a PAYING CUSTOMER? What gives you the RIGHT to EXPECT things to work?&#xd;
&#xd;
There were more votes, but they allowed the subject to be duplicated and refuse to merge the votes.  Not that it matters, because there appear to be very few ppl using the Service Desk, anyway. Since we have to fight votes from the main product, NOTHING will ever get done.&#xd;
&#xd;
These products are generally great and we love them.&#xd;

We got the TOC macro to work for us, but after research it is working only on pages that are using the Page include macro. This helps us a little, because we are using the Page include macro only on pages restricted to our agents that require sign-in to view.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, on pages that do not require sign-in the Page include macro is "unable to render" and completely worthless. &#xd;
&#xd;
Again, sorry for false hope, maybe this limited use workaround will help someone with a similar use case.</text><author>S Helms</author></comments><comments><text>Thanks Sharon. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is one of things that is quite hard to test in all it's variations. I get the feeling that the Jira devs / bosses rarely experience this issue because their config is differently set. &#xd;

Out of sight-out of mind.</text><author>John Walker</author></comments><comments><text>...which makes me think.

&#xd;
How in the world is that fair.  We ***PAY*** for service desk to work and something as rudimentary as listing our wiki pages there is part of the integration for which we decided to risk our support business.  Our business relies VERY heavily on our Docs way more than FAQ or KB or actually registering issues.  So we are VERY hard hit with this ridiculous BUG they refuse to fix.&#xd;
&#xd;
Love/hate relationship.  Love SO MUCH of Confluence and Jira.  But this sours everything every day we have to spirit them over to a BOX.COM site to DOWNLOAD a PDF, when the wiki page could have been available in the support center directly...  And formatted better than the derived PDF.&#xd;

Apparently, it is ONLY about the votes.  We users of JSD just don't have the weight to make them fix a KNOWN BUG that is debilitating for our use.&#xd;

&#xd;
What is really upsetting is that they are rolling out a *RIDICULOUS update* to the JSD/Support Center where there is now a completely *USELESS* screen that our customers have to CLICK through to GET to where they submit a ticket.  They EMPHASIZE the SEARCH, which is WORTHLESS TO US since the confluence documents CANNOT be displayed - ours are complex and *useless without the display of the Table Of Contents*.  What good is a long document that does not have a hot linked Table Of Contents???&#xd;
&#xd;
They spent time on a *useless, annoying, superfluous update that NOBODY ASKED FOR*.  But they can't fix a basic flaw that makes our Confluence PAGES TOTALLY USELESS, and to add insult to injury, they HIGHLIGHT the Search that is only good to display our Confluence pages without Tables of Contents.&#xd;
&#xd;
BRILLIANT...&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>I'm amazed that this issue was raised in 2016 and now in 2019 it still exists!!&#xd;

If you have it working in Confluence, how hard it is to make it work on where it matters the most??? Where our customers need easy to use KB? Thank god I'm on a trial period, Atlassian just lost another customer. So much for conversion.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Gil</author></comments><comments><text>We are equally shocked.  They just rolled out an "improvement" to the Support Center with a TOTALLY unnecessary front page, but they can't fix this basic functionality.  And the new page emphasizes the SEARCH and results in Confluence pages without TOCs.  Ours are complex, and the lack of TOC makes them TOTALLY UNUSABLE.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Is there a work around to link on the page to jump down at least?

You can use "anchor" links for navigating. Create anchor macro where you want to jump to and then add a link for the same through the link functionality -> advanced

The new editor does not currently have the *Anchor macro*, and the Confluence developers are suggesting that we use the *Table of Contents macro* instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, as users of both Confluence and Jira Service Desk, we know that using the TOC macro is not a good workaround because *it is broken in the customer portal*.&#xd;
&#xd;
Atlassian developers – please help, and resolve at least one of these issues before the new Confluence editor is rolled out to everyone!</text><author>S Helms</author></comments><comments><text>@Sharon, good luck with that.&#xd;
&#xd;
I suggest everyone who is interested in getting this fixed begin a campaign of CALLING in to their support and SUBMITTING online issues on this *BUG*.  They track that.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Yeah, this is not going to be fixed any time soon.&#xd;
&#xd;
And that's not even the biggest problem with the portal view.&#xd;
&#xd;
Try the stupid narrow view that doesn't allow for proper viewing of screenshots. &#xd;
&#xd;
Not having the ability to click on a screenshot and expend it.&#xd;
&#xd;
Occupying screen real-estate with the redundant 'Was this article helpful' floating to the right, from an already narrow view.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Clearly, QA simply didn't work on this product.&#xd;

??That being said the team is exploring how we can ship a *{color:#ff0000}better {color}out of the box* knowledge experience with Jira Service Desk Cloud. ??&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
How about live up to the word "better" and just fix what supposed to be working in the first place?&#xd;
&#xd;
How can you honestly think we'll believe you, your team, Atlassian when you write "We currently do not plan on focusing efforts to resolve this behaviour in the near future" and then write "That being said the team is exploring how we can ship a better *out of the box* knowledge experience with Jira Service Desk Cloud."&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Seriously? What's there to explore? You write that "we do listen", yet you clearly DO NOT! You might "hear" us but you're not listening. We need TOC working! How about starting there for "better out of the box"?&#xd;
&#xd;
TOC suppose to work out of the box.&#xd;
&#xd;
No exploration needed. We, mere mortals, tell you that we want this fixed, yet you ignore and set sail to explore brave new worlds as if it's some rocket science. Stop "exploring" and fix the basic things we all need, and then go and explore. &#xd;
&#xd;
Do you want to provide better OOTB experience? Stop looking and see what's in front of you!&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
p.s. - last week my team and I noticed that some articles in our KB had their TOC working. I assumed it was 'silently' fixed.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Gil</author></comments><comments><text>Nope, still not working.  At least not for us.&#xd;
&#xd;
Dylan, and anyone else from Jira who actually looks at these comments...  Please stop acting like this is some new feature that people are asking for.  It's not.  It's BROKEN FUNCTIONALITY.  Honestly, this is Commercial Software Development 101: Before spending lots of time working on new features and improvements, you make sure that what you've already created actually WORKS.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm happy to email Vincent Wong, as you suggested – but honestly, we shouldn't have to do that.  Jira Service Desk is not a high-end complex case management tool, we all know that.  We use it because it does have one really cool, helpful, and extremely worthwhile feature.  That feature is instant, seamless integration with Confluence for KB articles.&#xd;
&#xd;
In other words, one of the main reasons ANY of your customers are using this product AT ALL, is that we all really like how easy it is to publish things in Confluence, and Service Desk promises to extend that to customer-facing KB documents.&#xd;
&#xd;
So we shouldn't have to beg, or vote, or argue, or plead with you in order to have someone recognize that this is important.  The fact that so many Confluence macros simply do not work at all in SD is just... broken.  In a lot of cases, it makes the product actually have negative value, since it creates more work than it saves.&#xd;
&#xd;
You want to know how you "ship a better out of the box knowledge experience"?  It's actually pretty easy.  You start by taking the features that are ALREADY in the box.  And then you make them work the way they're supposed to.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Marc Jensen</author></comments><comments><text>Marc, it was working last week, so much that I edited old articles and added TOC to them.&#xd;
&#xd;
This morning I realised it stopped working. The timing couldn't be any more suspicious with Dylan's announcement and the fact it's not working anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
Funny, they can build all these products but can't have TOC working for articles. &#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Gil</author></comments><comments><text>Guys as frustrating as this is, please don't yell at Dylan. I've been in his shoes before with having to relay internal info to customers that wasn't ideal but it also wasn't my fault. Dylan's just doing is his job with updating us on the status which is good. Now the status isn't what anybody wanted and yeah it kind of sucks that they're sending us to an email address but apparently that's the person we need to talk to in order to get attention on this. Berating them in this ticket thread won't help get this issue resolved.</text><author>Carolynn Carriger</author></comments><comments><text>Carolynn, I re-read Marc's comments and find them SPOT ON.  He is clear, concise, analytical, and accurate.  If you think those comments are too brusque, maybe you have not suffered enough from the lies that Atlassian has spouted about this for the last years.  What about releasing NEW front pages for JSD when the existing one DOES NOT WORK, and the new ones make the problem worse by HILITING the SEARCH that is impotent without TOCs in our complex documents.&#xd;
&#xd;
Carolynn, I will NOT hide my frustration and disgust at the abuse Atlassian has dealt me, my company, and all others who desperately need this BROKEN SOFTWARE fixed.  &#xd;
&#xd;
While I will always be civil, ANYONE at Atlassian NEEDS to appreciated our intense displeasure at their abuse.  He should PASS our ANGER up the chain and let the incompetent management know the results of their flawed approach to ignoring customers who report NON-FUNCTIONAL software...&#xd;
&#xd;
He is welcome to pass the heat up the line to whatever passes as "management" at that ridiculous organization.  Let them KNOW how we feel.  &#xd;
&#xd;
{color:#de350b}*IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE WE WERE DECEIVED.*{color}  &#xd;
&#xd;
And they continue to jerk us around.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Dylan, please re-read what you wrote.  Do you see how INSANE it sounds?&#xd;
&#xd;
You profess to deliver a MAJOR and SIGNIFICANT feature.  You hook us into investing in it, and it does not work.  There is no workaround.  The functionality, critical to the operation of JSD as DESIGNED, simply DOES NOT WORK.&#xd;
&#xd;
And you pass down some corporate gobbledygook techspeak about an OUT OF THE BOX EXPERIENCE?&#xd;
&#xd;
You sound like they have you on drugs and you will repeat any nonsensical rationalization they pour on your head.&#xd;
&#xd;
Placing multiple requests to FIX a broken function IN DETAIL is not enough, we have to stroke the ego of this Wong guy and be INTERVIEWED so he can magically find out what we want - to "DISCUSS OUR REQUIREMENTS".  RUDE!  Maybe, just maybe, Wong can READ THIS THREAD and COMPREHEND IT?  Make TOC work in JSD.  How freaking simple can we state the need?&#xd;
&#xd;
We have been clear.  CRYSTAL CLEAR.  This is ALL we ask.  TOC in JSD.  Simple.&#xd;
&#xd;
Don't RE-engineer the product, just make this work.&#xd;
&#xd;
How dense are you people?&#xd;
&#xd;
How rude can you be with your statements of "listening carefully to customer feedback"?  This is NOT feedback, this is a BUG REPORT that is unequivocal.&#xd;
&#xd;
JSD is about to NOT play a role in our organization.  How about that?</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Same issue here... Table of contents not working when confluence knowledge base article is shown in service desk portal...</text><author>Jelmer Spiekstra</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,&#xd;
&#xd;
I am new to Service Desk and I'm experiencing the same issue. Seeing that this bug is almost 4 years old, I must be honest in expressing that by not being able to have a working table of contents for my articles and my readers, it's going to be a pain to figure out another way to make my knowledge base easy to use. It's certainly going to add hours of work to make sense of it all. I'm already discovering other handy features within Confluence are broken in translation; I have spent a lot of time setting up articles to find out later that anchor macros, links to headers, and emoji's (including several custom ones I'd imported and added to articles) also are dysfunctional. &#xd;
&#xd;
I've submitted a community question relating to the header links issue here: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Desk-questions/Header-links-open-new-browser-tab-to-the-customer-portal-instead/qaq-p/1228601&#xd;
&#xd;
I really wish that there was documentation on what features I can actually use. It might save me loads of time. Better yet, Jira should remove the broken macros and other tools from the KB article editor in Confluence altogether so we aren't fooled into thinking they'll work.&#xd;
&#xd;
*All said, according to the bug severity rating, there should be a workaround available. What is that workaround?* Below is the priority description. (I disagree that it is a 3; I think it should be a 2 because job function is somewhat impaired. Plus one of their examples for priority 2 is precisely what is happening here – "specific editing features fail"!)&#xd;
&#xd;
_Priority 3 - Medium_&#xd;
&#xd;
_The application or specific feature isn't working as expected, but there is a workaround available. Users' experience is impacted, but their job function is not impaired._&#xd;
&#xd;
One last thing – I noticed that Jira's own help articles seem to support links to headers. Or perhaps they're using yet another working feature that I haven't discovered yet. Does anyone know what they might be doing, and if it's available to us customers? (As it should be.)&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you all,&#xd;

 </text><author>Laura Sands</author></comments><comments><text>Laura, the fact that Atlassian does not "(eat its own) dogfood" its cloud products is a standing complaint for a few years.  You are absolutely correct that Atlassian uses 3rd party tools to generate its support environment and knowledgebase that are not available to cloud users.</text><author>Abel Lineberger</author></comments><comments><text>Abel, I can handle them not eating their own dogfood, ***IF*** they were responsive to the people who were forced to eat it. &#xd;
&#xd;
Laura, THERE IS NO WORKAROUND.  They will mention that you can MANUALLY create a MANUAL TABLE and MANUALLY create LINKS in the Headings.  Some of our Tables have scores of links and we use the NUMBERED SECTION macro and that makes it UNMANAGEABLE to attempt to do manually.  *THERE IS NO WORKAROUND, and they just do not care.*&#xd;
&#xd;
All I get from them is blah blah blah BS and only once have they actually admitted they have NO INTENT ON FIXING IT.  &#xd;
&#xd;
But they had time to "fix" (rework) the main portal page to EMPHASIZE SEARCH - that we cannot use effectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Get on their Facebook page and ads and talk about this.*&#xd;

Thank you Sharon.&#xd;
&#xd;
**** you, Atlassian, for ignoring this for years and refusing to fix it, and not researching to find this workaround.  </text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Ira - Partial joy on the workaround.  I can see it generates a TOC, but the automatically generated anchor links don't seem to work.  Did your implementation get that working?</text><author>Abel Lineberger</author></comments><comments><text>Here's a workaround that I found. You can try using the "Children Display" macro instead of the TOC or Page Tree. This is primarily for linking to subsequent articles rather than in-article page headers. For those suffering from that navigation problem, this seems to work well. The only limitation is that you have to choose to either display descendants or not. The macro doesn't allow for expandable top level navigation. It's either all out there or just the top level.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
EDIT: I guess you can't upload images to comments in here. Just go and play with the "Children Display" macro. It's pretty intuitive. </text><author>Chris Mendicino</author></comments><comments><text>@abel, I am unclear what you mean by "automatically generated anchor links".  The TOC that is generated has all the items listed as hyperlinks, and when I click them from the TOC, it jump to that topic and it shows on the top of the browser window.  Am I missing something?&#xd;
&#xd;
We did nothing more than create the doc, set the H1-H5 pgh types, create a standard TOC, publish, edit, delete the standard TOC, insert the TOC Zone macro, publish and it works.&#xd;
&#xd;
Could it be that we create a standard TOC first (that does not work in JSD) and then replaced it with the new TOC Zone crap?&#xd;
&#xd;
That would be a simple fix.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Thanks, @chrismendicino. I'll keep the children display option in mind. For now I'm using TOC-zone per Sharon's instructions at [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Desk-questions/Header-links-open-new-browser-tab-to-the-customer-portal-instead/qaq-p/1228601#U1237802.] </text><author>Laura Sands</author></comments><comments><text>@Chris - I tried the Children Display and cannot get it to display Headings in the document itself.  I tried various settings but do not ever see headings of any level listed.  Since there are no "child" docs, I get a list of nothing at all.  What am I missing?</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>AND, the converted doc using the "Table of Content ZONE" works fine.&#xd;
&#xd;
BUT!!!&#xd;
&#xd;
If you try to copy or cut the content from within the TOCZ macro, it loses ALL formatting, specifically headings.  So apparently, once the content is copied INTO the TOCZ macro, it will never come out again with formatting.  This is likely another wonderful feature that Atlassian will ignore for the five years.</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Folks!&#xd;
&#xd;
As a part of our efforts to make sure that our bug reports have as much useful information in them as they can, I've gone through and reverified this issue, updated the issue description to make it a bit clearer, and found then verified a workaround.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanking [Sharon Helms|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/976803] for his [Atlassian community post|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Desk-questions/Header-links-open-new-browser-tab-to-the-customer-portal-instead/qaq-p/1228601?utm_source=atlcomm] kindly providing a workaround. We understand this may not be optimal and require manual modification of the existing pages, however, we hope it will help give our customers something to go off until an official fix for the bug is deployed.&#xd;

Atlassian Support</text><author>Asim K</author></comments><comments><text>And what you do NOT mention, after having the community do the work for the VENDOR - ATLASSIAN who refuses to fix this after years of requests - is the the TOCZ macro is weird.&#xd;
&#xd;
In MY experience, once you paste content into it, *you CANNOT copy and paste it OUT of the TOCZ with its formatting*.  All you get is unformatted plain text.&#xd;
&#xd;
I suppose this could be YET ANOTHER bug that Atlassian decides to IGNORE for the next millenia...&#xd;

I am just getting started on a new JSD-Confluence project, and do not have so many articles that I would not pivot to something else at this early stage. We will have many articles and TOC is critical to helping the customers understand the major concepts of the docs. Just common sense. JSD-Confluence "out of the box" will cause more frustration for our customers.</text><author>Mike Tocci</author></comments><comments><text>Mike, yes.  TOC is critical.  The only possible workaround seems to be using the TOC*ZONE* macro around the whole body.  There are some big limitations using that, but we have had to employ it, since WE cannot find a palatable replacement for JSD at this time.  We ARE actively looking, and as soon as we get some bandwidth, we are *OUTA HERE*!&#xd;
&#xd;
Atlassian has consistently shown that progressing through their own echo-chamber of new features is FAR more important than fixing the ones that impact existing customers.  They even work AGAINST us, like the latest update to the JSD entry screen that EMPHASIZES the search function, that is rendered useless since the resulting Confluence docs cannot have a TOC.  our docs are long and complex, and useless without TOC.  So instead of fixing that, five year old BUG, they doubled down on the search and spent time to release that.  Hideous decisions by an obviously deaf and brain dead company.&#xd;
&#xd;
Good luck finding a KB alternative.  We will post here if we find something viable...</text><author>Ira Chandler</author></comments><comments><text>I guess one way to look at it is: Atlassian, like everyone, relies heavily on page tree and TOC style orientation to help customers work their way through complex information. Like this: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-confluence-cloud/before-you-start-space-ace-934720197.html]&#xd;

We rolled out a fix for the TOC macro last week as some of you may have seen, but we had to roll it back as it caused regressions in other content.

*NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Service Desk Cloud*. Using *JIRA Service Desk Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3562].&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The SLA disappears if the stop condition is set to an event that issue/s have already gone through.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new SD project, using the default SLA settings for "Time to response" and "Time to resolution";&#xd;
 # Create a new issue under that project and assign it to an user;&#xd;
 # Go to the configuration of any SLA and add "Assignee: Changed" as a "Stop" condition;&#xd;
 # Go back to the assigned issue, notice the SLA is missing;&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Behavior&#xd;
&#xd;
Stop the SLA and register completion based on occurrence of event. In this case, the SLA of the issue should be stopped and continue showing.&#xd;
h3. Actual Behavior&#xd;
&#xd;
If you check the missing SLA through the below REST API, you will notice that it has the start and stop events right, with the stop condition matching the event of assignee changed.&#xd;
&#xd;
{{&lt;JIRA-Base-URL>/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/&lt;Project-Key>/sla/debug/issue/&lt;Issue-Key>/metric/&lt;SLA-ID>/data}}&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Manually reconstruct the SLA for this issue, which will use the timestamp of "Stop" event to set the complete SLA data. In order to do so, perform a {{POST}} request on {{&lt;JIRA-Base-URL>/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/sla/admin/task/destructive/reconstruct?force\=true}} with a JSON array of affected issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
See example below using cURL.&#xd;

h3. Summary
Customer Accounts (therefore, Customer Portal Access only) are coming up as an option to use as a Project Lead/Default Assignee in Service Desk.

h3. Environment
* JIRA 7.1.0-OD-05-006
* JIRA Service Desk - 3.2.0-OD-01-001-D20160127T101633

h3. Steps to Reproduce
# On an instance with SD and valid customer accounts, navigate to a project (any type, does not need to be SD)
# Go to *Project Administration > Users and Roles*
# Click *Edit Defaults* in top-right
# Type the name of a customer account, and it displays in the search results.

 !Screen Shot 2016-02-02 at 10.58.44.jpg|thumbnail! 

h3. Expected Results
The search results should only display users that should have access to be added as a Project Lead. Especially not Customer accounts.

h3. Actual Results
Customer accounts are displayed as potential options for Project Lead

h3. Summary:
If we attach an empty text file on the Request form, a Warning Banner will appear. But, the warning did not disappear even when the right file is attached on the request.

h3. Steps to Reproduce:
# Create a Service Desk project.
# Add the "Attachment" field on one of the Request Type.
_Service Desk Project Administration > Request Types > select the Request > Edit fields_
# Navigate to the Customer Portal and select the request type
# Create an Empty Text File and select it on the form.
# A warning will appears.
# Attach another Text File that is not empty.

h3. Expected Result:
* The warning will disappear and the file is attached.

h3. Actual Result:
* The file is attached and the warning still appears.

h3. Notes:
* If the warning did not disappear, at least it should behave like it will automatically disappear even though there is no file attached yet.</description><createDate>2015-12-24T11:05:55.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Fixed this issue in another ticket: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-3104</text><author>Albert</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Broken images in SD emails</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-2324</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-2324</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}

h3. Summary

*Images are broken in email:*
This is a problem with the JIRA Service Desk. When an image is attached by an internal account or by a customer, the image that shows up in the automated email is broken.

h3. Steps to Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce \[bug 1\]:
# Create a Service Desk ticket as an agent or as a customer. Here is the portal: 
# Make sure your Agent account is the assignee. Make sure your customer account is the customer on the ticket.
# Log in as an Agent  and navigate to the Service Desk.
# Open that ticket on behalf of a customer for editing and go to "More" and select "Attach Files".
# Make an external comment and attach an image to it.
# Log into the email account associated with the customer account. You should see the email come through with a broken image for the attached email. 

\[bug 2\] The problem also happens the vice-versa direction, and presumably this is the same underlying issue:
# Log in as a Customer  and navigate to your list of open tickets.
# Edit the same ticket and add an image to a comment.
# Log into the email account associated with your Agent account

\[bug 3\] A third related problem is when you comment and add the attachment on the same time, JIRA doesn't recognize that it exists when it sends the email, so the email contains an error message for the attachments, saying it doesn't exist, even though it is successfully added to the ticket. Another email is sent right after saying the attachment was added:
# Same steps as above, only add the attachment on commenting, by clicking the attachment icon

\[bug 4\] This can also be replicated with emoticons.

h3. Expected Results

The customer should receive an automated email with that external comment. 

h3. Actual Results
\[bug 1 and 2\] In first two cases, the images are broken:
!attachment_after_commenting.png|thumbnail!

\[bug 3\] The third problem shows this:
!attachments_when_commenting.png|thumbnail!

\[bug 4\] Here is the emoticons problem:
!emoticons.png|thumbnail!

h3. Note

It seems that an agent emailing him/herself does not cause this problem.

h3.Workaround
None so far.</description><createDate>2015-09-15T16:58:56.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Attachments are broken for external emails parsed by the mail handler as well.

  {panel}

h3. Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new Service Desk project.
2. Add an automation rule with the following setup:
* *WHEN*: Issue created
* *IF*: Issue matches - Issue Type is "IT Help"
* *THEN*: Transition issue to {{Respond to customer}}

3. Add the "Attachment" field to the IT Help type on the customer portal.
4. Create two issues via Service Desk > Create a Service Desk Request, one with an attachment and one without (the attachment can be anything, I've been using a text file containing the word "test").

h3. Expected results
Both issues will be transitioned to {{Waiting for customer}}.

h3. Actual results
The issue with no attachment transitions correctly, but the issue with the attachment remains in {{Waiting for support}}.
# The Customer Request view says "Your request status changed to Requester action Needed" but the status isn't updated to match: [^request.png] 
# In the database, the status actually shows that its in {{Waiting For Support}}, but the transitions on the issue shows that its in {{Waiting for Customer}}. See [^TransitionsAreIncorrect.png]
# The transition seems to have activated for a second or less, before reverting back to {{Waiting For Support}}. If you have the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin installed, you can actually see the status *was* in {{Waiting for Customer}} for one second. See [^JSUTransitions.png]
# Running the Integrity Checker for workflows shows us exactly what the problem is: [^IntegrityChecker.png] the workflow current step have been corrupted by the automation due to the attachment bug. The integrity checker is able to fix it. 

h3. Workaround
Remove the *Attachment* from the Visible Fields form so that users are forced to attach their files after the requests have been created.
Considering the same data from the *Steps to Reproduce* section, the workaround can be applied with the steps below:
# Navigate to the desired Service Desk configuration screen.
# Go to *Settings > Request Types*.
# Select *IT Help > Edit fields*.
# In the *Visible fields* section, remove the *Attachment* field.</description><createDate>2015-07-13T07:55:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi [~nmason],

This works as design because there are 2 events running when a new request is created with an attachment:
- Create issue
- Issue comment (adding attachment is being treated as adding a comment)

And there are 2 automation rules in your SD project which are configured to get status updated accordingly.
- Create issue -> New automation rule which you described above -> Status = "Waiting for Customer"
- Issue comment (by adding attachment) -> Default automation rule of SD project (Transition on comment) -> Status = "Waiting for Support"

Any more concern, more than happy to discuss. Otherwise, I'll close this shortly as "Worked as design" resolution.

Nga Lai
JIRA Service Desk Team</text><author>Nga Lai</author></comments><comments><text>Create a request with an attachment when there is only one automation rule for that SD project:
1. Customer create a request for IT help in Customer Portal
2. It meets condition in automation rule -> status is changed to "Waiting for customer" - that's why you also see the message in CP "Your request status changed to Requester action Needed."
3. Then attachment of that request is added via a comment which made the status change to "Waiting for support" - this is from the setting of Workflow
		
These 3 activities happen at the same minute but in a sequence like that.
The root cause of this problem is because we separate "create a request" and "attachment" into 2 activities and then the automation rule interferes in the middle of them.

h5. Issue Summary
When a user translates his statuses in JIRA and sets his language to a preferred language, if he navigates to customer portal of Service Desk, some of the language change is not obeyed and this also affects emails sent by Service Desk to the users.

Attached are 2 Screenshots that can serve as samples:
* !E-mail notification.jpg|thumbnail!
* !E-mail notification1.jpg|thumbnail!

h5. Expected Behaviour
The notification all over should follow the specified translations to the language rather than English Language.

h5. Actual Behaviour
Some statuses or messages generated by JIRA still contain some parts in English, even despite the customer specifying the appropriate translation for them within JIRA.</description><createDate>2015-07-02T08:46:50.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Let me add that this does also affect Version 2.5.4 on my side.

When we have an issue in 'Waiting for Customer' status and the customer triggers the transition to 'Waiting for Support' by commenting on the issue, the customer's comment is added, but the page is not refreshed after the transition is made. 

That results in the page showing the old status (Waiting for Customer) and the customer has to refresh the page to see the new status.

This makes the customers confused, as it is not clear that the transition was correctly triggered.</description><createDate>2015-04-08T16:42:05.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We're using JSD 3.0.10 (last stages of evaluation) and this is still an issue.

If you navigate to a service desk via the link at the top of a jira instance

http://cl.ly/image/1m2Y1t320J3C
Service Desk menu -> All Service Desks

http://cl.ly/image/011m401V1900
Find a desk -> Customer Portal

This opens up a dialog. Now, attempt to file a ticket from this dialog. When I clicked on the submit button on the create ticket form, I got a spinner for around 20 seconds. Because of this latency I went to another tab or got a coffee or something, I don't remember what.

When I came back, my spinner was gone and the form was still present with indication of success or failure. I clicked create again. This time I had the same experience. No indication of success or failure.

The ticket in question was created 3 times before I decided to click around in the interface to figure out if it was getting created or not.</description><createDate>2015-03-09T06:32:31.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This sounds like the problem when Customer Request Type has been hidden on a project.</text><author>Matthew McMahon</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Non-Latin characters don't work in Request Name / Display names for customer portal fields</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-1419</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1419</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}

Steps:

1. Go to Settings > Request types and then click Edit fields for any of request types.
2. Fill in Display names in Russian, Greek or some other language using a non-Latin alphabet. (you can copy and paste this: "Описание").
3. Save and refresh.

Result: 
Non-latin characters are lost, question marks are shown instead.

Hi everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks for your patience with us on this bug, I understand it must be inconvenient to use the workaround for the time being. My engineering team is currently in the process of transferring components and will be learning/ramping up on their new area within the coming months. 🙂 We are currently in the process of sorting through all of your customer feedback and identifying what we will be able to reasonably take on and add to our roadmap during the coming months. I will update you as soon as we have more solid plans!&#xd;
&#xd;
Warm regards,&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The customers (both portal-only customers and the ones having Atlassian account) can see the issues in the [public Jira projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/allowing-anonymous-access-to-your-project-779172888.html] when they are not logged in to JIRA Service Desk portal. Once they login to the JIRA Service Desk portal, however, they can't any longer view the issues in the public Jira projects. Keeps on getting redirected to the JIRA Service Desk portal.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create or use a [public Jira project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/allowing-anonymous-access-to-your-project-779172888.html].&#xd;
 # View an existing issue in the publicly accessible Jira project via a browser where you're not signed in to any Atlassian cloud product.&#xd;
 # Issue views successfully.&#xd;
 # In the same browser, open another tab and log in with an existing portal-only customer in a Jira service desk portal of the same public project.&#xd;
 # Try to view the same issue again from step#: 2&#xd;
 # You will be redirected to the Jira service desk portal.&#xd;
 # (Optional) - [Migrate the portal-only-user to the Atlassian account|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-jira-service-desk-customer-accounts-913213935.html#ManageJiraServiceDeskcustomeraccounts-HowcanIgivelicensestocustomersIwanttocollaboratewithintrueorConfluence?].&#xd;
 # Repeat steps 2-6 again&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The publicly accessible project issues should be accessible in both cases i.e. When the portal-only customer account is logged into the portal or not logged in.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The publicly accessible project issues are accessible only when the customer is not logged into the portal.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
A possible workaround could be to use two different browsers until this bug is fixed. One browser window to login to the portal and another browser to view the public issues. Alternatively, the same browser can be used with one standard window and another private browsing (incognito) to view public issues.&#xd;
{panel:title=Example Use Case|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#f7d6c1|bgColor=#ffffce}&#xd;
All our customers can have a service desk customer account which they need to ask support. If a customer uses this service desk to e.g. request a feature, we might log this as a feature request in our "public" jira (a jira project where anyone can view the issues and see their progress). Typically, the service desk ticket is then closed with a message that a feature request is made (with a link to it) and that we plan to deliver this feature then or then.&#xd;
&#xd;
An anonymous user can - like expected - view the ticket. If that user then clicks on login, he can login using his service desk customer login, and can still see the ticket and navigate the public jira project. However, once he visits the service desk portal, he cannot return to the public jira project anymore, as he keeps being redirected to the service desk interface.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, we want all users (anonymous and service desk customers) to view and browse our public jira project.&#xd;

It is very confusing for our internal customers to need to log out to view some tickets, while needing to log in to request personal help.</text><author>Jared Kipe</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,

After a discussion with Atlassian support (SDS-5664), I really think that this issue is a (functional) bug. It is really hard to make Service Desk customer log off, check the Jira project that is supposed to be public and then log in again to answer on the Service Desk issue. I won't say that it is blocking but it is a major issue.
Would it be possible to re-qualify it?

Best regards.</text><author>Jean-Denis Coffre</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,
I do agree on make this as a bug rather than a suggestion. System would still allow SD customer to view public JIRA issue instead of doing redirection to share portal.
Thanks</text><author>Thong Bui Quang</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,

An update on progress with this issue, is that we began work on constructing a solution.

The intention was to "trick" JIRA into believing that a Service Desk customer can also be considered an anonymous user inside JIRA. However we soon realised that this has design challenges and leads to what we would consider an even more confusing experience for customers. For example, the follow user flow might help illustrate the situation:

* The user logins in to the portal

!no1-image2015-7-22 10-6-42.png|thumbnail!

* Now they KNOW they are logged in. They end up at some place that links them back into JIRA

!no2-image2015-7-22 10-8-19.png|thumbnail!

* Ok now they are in JIRA platform and our effectively anonymous code has kicked in. But WAT - JIRA tells them to login

!no3-image2015-7-22 10-10-47.png|thumbnail!

* But have logged in right - they did it themselves. Ok so maybe they wont see that. They navigate some more, say to the dashboard

!no4-image2015-7-22 10-18-19.png|thumbnail!

* Now the call to action here is login - wat? And if they do try to login they get this

!no5-image2015-7-22 10-19-55.png|thumbnail!

* ok I am out of here this is freaking me out. Let me press back button and get to the portal again where I am safe

!no6-image2015-7-22 10-22-33.png|thumbnail!

----

As you can see from the user flow, there are many inconsistencies with the attempted approach. While this might achieve the purpose of this issue, it will likely only raise further concerns / confusion for customers.

So rather than simply living with this experience, and marking this issue as fixed, we are going back to the drawing board.

The intention is that the finished result will be a seamless / deliberate user experience within JIRA and JIRA Service Desk, that leaves no place for confusion.

Thank you for your patience.

Matt

Servicedesk would check for the servicedesk cookie, and load that session if set, otherwise check for the jira cookie and load that session if set, otherwise display the login.
Jira would check for the jira cookie and load that session if set, otherwise the anon user would be used and the login form shown.

The login capabilities of servicedesk could be thrown away and replaced with the stock jira login form, setting the appropriate cookie upon successful auth.</text><author>Jared Kipe</author></comments><comments><text>How about at least adding an option to offer "regular" (JIRA) public sign-up when Service Desk-only public sign-up is disabled?

We've been evaluating the Service Desk for several weeks now and this issue appears to be a blocker problem for us. Has any of the commenters here found any satisfying workaround?
@Matthew McMahon [Atlassian], can I ask if there's been any progess on this work? Also, wouldn't something like @David [Innovalog] 's suggestion be possible, so basically to bypass the SD sign-up for the time being and let users create a public JIRA account, which would let them view and vote on public issues?

&#xd;
Here is what I tried:&#xd;
 * I logged out of my Cloud instance&#xd;
 * I navigated to /servicedesk/customer/portals&#xd;
 * It asked me to log in or create an account. I created an account (a "customer" account)&#xd;
 * I received the email, validated my new account, ended up on the portal&#xd;
 * from there, I was able to create new SD requests&#xd;
 * AND, I was also able to navigate to any public Confluence and Jira page! In fact, when I navigated to Jira or Confluence, I was considered as "anonymous" (not logged in)!&#xd;
&#xd;
It looks like Atlassian might finally have solved the problem by separating the HelpDesk login from the "normal" Jira Cloud login.

As Atlassian system owners for our companies, much of how we learn is by using the products with Atlassian directly. I can reach out to Atlassian Support Portal, I can vote, watch, or comment on an Atlassian JSDCLOUD bug or feature. &#xd;
&#xd;
Yet, when I turn around and try to offer the same service to my customers, it fails.&#xd;

 Atlassian Support</text><author>Asim K</author></comments><comments><text>This is real problem. We want to use Jira software to better manage our non-Service desk projects. However our users can't even view the issues. Being able to link tickets across projects is a real positive feature. &#xd;
&#xd;
I have just setup a project, and added Public sharing which explicitly states that "including logged in Users" can browse the project. Even when the project is not public, the User can't browse the project. &#xd;
&#xd;
This ticket is over 5 Years old, and clearly a bug. This is also preventing sales of your product. How do we get this in front a the Altassian marketing team ?&#xd;

As a customer requesting support for a product, I already had contact with this bug twice recently. Seeing this bug is not being addressed within the next months and estimating that I am not the only customer struggling with this, this bug is really causing a lot of work and costs for all companies using the JSD for support. For the support this means additional requests that are only with respect to problems on "how to use the service desk", taking away valuable time that could be put into helping customers seeking the support for their product.&#xd;

When an agent pastes a link to a public Jira ticket, the default behavior is for this link to turn into a 'Smart Link' and be displayed 'Inline'.&#xd;
&#xd;
But on the customer's side the Inline Smart Link can't render properly because it can't fetch the link to the public Jira ticket when logged in as the Customer, so the customer only sees text of the Issue number, like PROJECT-12345, rather than a hyperlink.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have to ask each of our agents individually to change their [Link preferences|https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/link-preferences] for URLs to add the domain of our Atlassian Jira Cloud instance as an exception to only use a standard URL hyperlink format because support for managing this at the project or instance level is not yet implemented, see [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-79892|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-79892:].</text><author>Stevan</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>"Change Password" link is not hidden when "External User Management" is ON</summary><key>JSDCLOUD-976</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-976</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}

  {panel}

*Steps to Reproduce*:
# Integrate JIRA with Crowd/LDAP
# Set the Permission to "Read/Write"
# Move it to the top of the Directory List.
# Navigate to _JIRA Administration > General Configuration > Edit Settings_
# Turn On the "External User Management" option.
# Navigate to the current User Profile and the "Change Password" link is gone.
# Access JIRA Service Desk Customer Portal.
# Access the User Profile.

*Expected Result*:
The "Change Password" is removed from the profile same as JIRA User Profile as expected from 
- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27280

*Actual Result*:
The "Change Password" link is still appear and if the Directory permission in Crowd is set to true for "Modify User" the password will be changed.

h3. +Steps to Reproduce:+
# Install JIRA Service Desk;
# Create a Project through JIRA Service Desk;
# Disable or Uninstall JIRA Service Desk.

h3. +Expected Behavior:+
JIRA would hide/remove any configuration regarding JIRA Service Desk, and would continue to run normally.

h3. +Actual Behavior:+
* JIRA's dashboards stop working; 
* It is not possible to log in but through login.jsp;
* Accessing a project is not possible;
* Trying to view the Permission tab through the project created throws an error.

----
h3. +Workaround+

*+Option 1:+* Reinstall/Re-enable JIRA Service Desk.

*+Option 2:+*
# If unable to log in, access JIRA through http://&lt;jira-address>/login.jsp
# Navigate to *Administration » Issues » Permission Scheme*;
# Delete "*• (Anyone)*" from all permissions in all permission schemes.

*+Option 3:+*
Delete these from the database using:
{code:SQL| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}
DELETE FROM schemepermissions WHERE perm_type = 'sd.customer.portal.only';
{code}
(!) If deleting through the database, please make sure to create a backup. Also, make sure to shutdown JIRA first, and restart it afterwards.

----
h4. +Notes:+
This seems to be happening because JIRA Service Desk does not remove or hide the *Service Desk Customer - Portal Access (Anyone)* permission, and when JIRA tries to load it the following is thrown in the screen:
{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
When installing fresh installation or upgrading to Jira 10.5.0 UPM (The Universal Plugin Manager (v7.1.5)) runs a newly introduced check to verify the ownership of the directory JIRA-HOME OR JIRA-SHARED-HOME/upmconfig part of [Secure app installations with app signing|https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Data-Center-discussions/Introducing-App-signing-A-key-step-to-improve-App-security/td-p/2840244] .

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem occurs during the Basic Search but not in the Advanced Search.&#xd;
In the single-user picker field with project-specific context, selecting one user and then clicking the 'Search' button prevents the selection of any other users in the second attempt, resulting in a 'No matches' message even though the user is available in the dropdown options. However, during the first search attempt, multiple users can be found and selected simultaneously without this issue.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Create a custom field named 'Test Single User project' of type User Picker (Single User). &#xd;
2. Create three test users &#xd;
3.  Navigate to the Search Issue page. Under Basic Search, try to filter by 'Test Single User project'. In the first search, input the email addresses/username of the test users, and options appear in the dropdown for selection, as shown below:&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2025-03-25-17-53-28-690.png|width=464,height=208!&#xd;
4. Select a test user and click search&#xd;
5. Try searching for another user by entering their email address/username to select them from the list.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The dropdown should include the matching users.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The dropdown shows ‘No Matches’&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Change the context to global  for the affected custom field &#xd;
OR&#xd;
create a new custom field with global context for the purpose.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
As mentioned in the [Proforma listing on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215833/proforma-forms-checklist-for-jira?tab=overview&amp;hosting=datacenter], the Proforma is free for Jira users who are using JSM (Jira Service Management) on any version from 10.3.0:&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
For Jira Service Management Data Center 10.3 (and later) license holders, ProForma is free of charge! Explore our ProForma installation and licensing guide&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
However, whenever a Jira Admin tries to upgrade the Proforma app via the page *⚙ > Manage Apps > Manage Apps*, the Proforma app is diplayed in the UI as a paid app, causing a lot of confusion, since this app should be free.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to replicate&#xd;
&#xd;
- Install JSM on the version 10.3.0&#xd;
 !JSM_Version.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
- Download a Proforma version from [the version history page|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215833/proforma-forms-checklist-for-jira/version-history] that *is not the latest version*, for example 10.3.2-DC&#xd;
- Install this version in the JSM application via the page *⚙ > Manage Apps > Manage Apps*&#xd;
-- (i) To be able to upload this version via the Manage Apps page, you will to follow the steps from the KB article [How to re-enable plugin upload in Jira Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+re-enable+plugin+upload+in+Jira+Data+Center]&#xd;
- After the app is installed, check its listing in the page page *⚙ > Manage Apps > Manage Apps*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected behavior&#xd;
&#xd;
We should see an option to upgrade the app to the latest version *for free*.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual behavior&#xd;
&#xd;
- The message below is shown:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
You may update this app but the newest version isn't free. You can purchase a license through Atlassian.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
- The update button is shown as "Paid Update"&#xd;
&#xd;
 !PaidUpdateButton.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Ignore the message saying that the app is not for free, and simply click on the *Paid Update* button. The app will be upgraded for free without the need to enter any license:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira 9.x, the WebHooks queue size and the number of consumers were configurable.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, since Jira 10.0.0, these configurations have changed to hardcoded values, with the queue size set to a non-customizable limit of 250 and 5 consumers.&#xd;
&#xd;
This change results in webhook events being discarded when the queued tasks exceed this limit, with no workaround available, representing a regression from previous versions.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Configure some 10 WebHooks to listen to all the events available and do not "Exclude body"&#xd;
 # Setup a JMeter or other request automation to simulate Issue updates, transitions and comment creations.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira should allow for the customization of the WebHooks queue size and the number of consumers to handle events as in previous Jira versions. This would allow busier instances to process webhooks without dropping them.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
WebHooks queue size and the number of consumers are hardcoded to 250 and 5 respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file and webhook events are not processed.&#xd;

Hi everyone,&#xd;
 &#xd;
Thank you for your patience while we worked on this bug. We are pleased to announce its patch, available in the Jira Data Center 10.3.5 LTS release and the upcoming 10.6.0 release. To receive the fix, you'll need to [upgrade Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/upgrading-jira-applications-938846936.html].&#xd;
&#xd;
Please note that the steps to tune the webhook performance parameters in Jira 10 have changed. For instructions, please consult [Tuning webhook performance parameters in Jira Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1540850335]. Additionally, the default parameters were not modified during this patch, so organizations reaching service limits will need to apply the suggested parameters.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Can not upload attachments to wiki markup custom field when creating issue in new tab.&#xd;
&#xd;
When creating a new issue by opening a new tab (rather than the modal popup), wiki editor custom field cannot be used to add attachments. The system attachment field or description fields can be used for this purpose, but not a custom field with wiki editor.&#xd;
&#xd;
The custom field wiki editor has the attachments button disabled in the condition described above.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is the Create Issue form in a new tab where the attachments button gets disabled in the custom field (Environment) wiki editor:&#xd;
 !attachment_disabled.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
This is the Create Issue form in a modal popup where the attachments button is enabled in the custom field (Environment)  wiki editor:&#xd;
 !attachment_enabled.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# add a custom field with wiki editor to the create screen&#xd;
# Cmd+Click Create Issue will open the create form in a new tab&#xd;
# in the form, the custom field with wiki editor has the attachment button disabled&#xd;
# the system field with wiki editor has the attachment button enabled&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
In Jira 10.2.x and 10.3.x, the notification pop up for issue creation does not disappear automatically. This is inconsistent with the notification pop up for issue edit in the same version (which disappears automatically).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Set up Jira 10.2.x or 10.3.x&#xd;
# Create an issue&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The notification pop up will show up at the top right, and will disappear automatically after a few seconds.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The notification pop up will show up at the top right, but *will not* disappear automatically after a few seconds.&#xd;
(i) In 10.3.x, the issue creation notification pop up is missing the *aui-will-close* class.&#xd;
&#xd;
10.3.x - issue creation:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;div class="aui-message closeable aui-message-success">Issue &lt;a class="issue-created-key issue-link" data-issue-key="SCRUM-25" href="/jira/browse/SCRUM-25">SCRUM-25 - Test Issue 1&lt;/a> has been successfully created.&lt;button type="button" class="aui-close-button" aria-label="Close">&lt;/button>&lt;/div>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
10.3.x - issue edit:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;div class="aui-message closeable aui-message-success aui-will-close">SCRUM-25 has been updated.&lt;button type="button" class="aui-close-button" aria-label="Close">&lt;/button>&lt;/div>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
* Close the pop up window manually, OR&#xd;
* Refresh the page, OR&#xd;
* Access different page, OR&#xd;
* Add this to the announcement banner which will hide the notification after 1000ms (this is unsupported customization, script is provided as is)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;script type="text/javascript">&#xd;
function autocloseCreateNotification(loadEvent) {&#xd;
    url = loadEvent.currentTarget.responseURL;&#xd;
    if (url !== null &amp;&amp; url !== undefined &amp;&amp; url.indexOf("/QuickCreateIssue.jspa") >= 0) {&#xd;
        waitToAutocloseCreateNotification();&#xd;
    }&#xd;
};&#xd;
&#xd;
// Wait 1000ms for the AUI notification to pop up before deleting it.&#xd;
function waitToAutocloseCreateNotification() {&#xd;
    window.setTimeout(function() {&#xd;
        auiContainer = document.getElementById('aui-flag-container');&#xd;
        if (auiContainer !== null) {&#xd;
            auiNotifications = auiContainer.getElementsByClassName('aui-flag');&#xd;
            for (let auiNotification of auiNotifications) {&#xd;
                if (auiNotification.getAttribute('aria-label').indexOf('has been successfully created') >= 0) {&#xd;
                    auiNotification.remove();&#xd;
                }&#xd;
            }&#xd;
        }&#xd;
    }, 1000);&#xd;
}&#xd;

Issue Description&#xd;
&#xd;
As per [Jira 9.13.0 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-9-13-x-release-notes-1319569020.html#JiraSoftware9.13.xreleasenotes-add-watchers], Jira 9.13.0 introduced a new feature allowing watchers to be added to an issue from the "Create Issue" screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
As explained in the section *Add watchers while creating issues* of the release notes, to enable this feature, it is necessary to [enable the dark feature|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-manage-dark-features-in-jira-server-and-data-center-959286331.html] {*}com.atlassian.jira.initialwatchers.enabled{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
By design, when this dark feature is enabled, the *Watchers* field should be added to all the "Create Issue" screens.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, if the *Assignee* field is missing from the main tab of at least 1 "Create Issue" screen, the dark feature will fail to add the *Watchers* field to all the "Create Issue" screens (it might manage to add this field to some screens though). As a result:&#xd;
 - Some "Create Issue" Screens will be automatically added the *Watchers* field as illustrated below:&#xd;
!ExpectedBehavior_WatcherFieldIsAdded.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Some "Create Issue" screens will be missing the *Watchers* field as illustrated below&#xd;
!NonExpectedBehavior_WatcherFieldIsMissing.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to replicate&#xd;
&#xd;
There are 2 ways to replicate this bug.&#xd;
h4. Method 1&#xd;
 - Install Jira on any version from 9.13.0&#xd;

!DarkFeaturePage.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Open the configuration all the "Create Issue" screens in the whole Jira application and check if the *Watchers* field was added to them&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Method 2&#xd;
 - Install Jira on any version from 9.13.0&#xd;
 - Open the configuration of 1 "Create Issue" screen&#xd;
 - Create a new tab&#xd;
 - Remove the *Assignee* field from the main tab, and add it to the new tab&#xd;
!StepsToReplicate_Method2.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Enable the dark feature *com.atlassian.jira.initialwatchers.enabled*&#xd;
!DarkFeaturePage.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 - Open the configuration all the "Create Issue" screens in the whole Jira application and check if the *Watchers* field was added to them&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected behavior&#xd;
&#xd;
The *Watchers* field should be added to all the "Create Issue" screen in the whole Jira application.&#xd;
h3. Actual behavior&#xd;
 - The *Watchers* field is missing from all of some "Create Issue" screens&#xd;
 - Checking the Jira application logs, the error below will be thrown:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
For Jira DC v10.0 onwards, Project Administrators cannot bulk archive issues. They have the required permissions for 'Archive Issues,' and the user group holds global permission for 'Bulk Change.'&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Login to Jira 10.x.x as admin user&#xd;
 # Create a test user with 'Project Administrator' Role for a Test project&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Create a group (for eg. 'RG-JIRA-GENERAL-USR') and assign test user to this group&#xd;
 # Navigate to Global Permissions and provide the "Bulk Change" permission to this group.&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Go to 'test' project>Project Setting > Permission. Ensure that the "Administrator" role, which the test user is part of, has the "Archive Issue" permission.&#xd;
&#xd;
Now that the setup is complete, we can proceed to bulk archive issues from the 'Test' project by logging in as the Test User.&#xd;
 # Go to Issues>Search Issues> Filter by project 'test'&#xd;
 # Click on Tools&#xd;
 # Select one or more issue > Click Next&#xd;
 # Choose Operations> Archive Issue> Next&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Starting with v10.0, admin privileges are asked, or error 403 occurs while bulk archiving.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
There are conditions within Universal Plugin Manager (UPM) that may break its licensing feature.&#xd;
This may make the current node unusable to end-users, specially those features related to licensed Marketplace Apps.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install a vanilla instance of Jira Software Data Center.&#xd;
  #* This was validated on JSW DC versions 10.4.0, 9.12 and 9.4.&#xd;
 # Install a Marketplace App that will show a status of _DATA CENTER UPDATE AVAILABLE_.&#xd;
  #* See details about App statuses in [Upgrading Server apps when you migrate to Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/upgrading-server-apps-when-you-migrate-to-data-center-998660310.html].&#xd;
  #* Don't apply a license to the App.&#xd;
 # Go to _Versions &amp; licenses_ admin page.&#xd;
 # Edit the Jira Software license key and paste a new license.&#xd;
  #* You may use a trial license or one from [Timebomb licenses for testing server apps on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/timebomb-licenses-for-testing-server-apps/]&#xd;
 # Click on _Update license_&#xd;
  #* This triggers a {{POST /rest/plugins/applications/1.0/installed/jira-software/license}} request that results on a HTTP 400 status with a valid response from Jira.&#xd;
 # On the UI, a pop-up with "app will be impacted by this change" is shown.&#xd;
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
 # Click on _Cancel_ which won't proceed with the license change.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
No feature is impacted by this and Jira works normally as no change was committed.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
UPM licensing features break.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The option names within the comboboxes are not announced by the screen reader.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the Jira DC instance.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the header section and activate the "Create" control to open the "Create Issue" modal.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the mentioned comboboxes.&#xd;
 # Press the "Alt + Down Arrow" key and use the "Down Arrow" key to navigate through the options.&#xd;
 # Observe that the options are not announced by the screen reader.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Dropdown screen recording.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate through the options within the comboboxes, such as "Project", "Issue Type", "Fix Version/s", "Priority", "Sprint", "Labels", and others in the "Create Issue" modal, the option names are not announced. Instead, the screen reader remains silent, even though the options are changing visually.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are unable to interact with the options in these comboboxes and find it difficult to navigate through the available choices.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the option names in the combobox are announced for screen reader users.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this case, Along with defining role=“combobox”, “aria-expanded”, “Aria-controls”, “aria-haspopup”, on the &lt;input> element.&#xd;
&#xd;
The &lt;input> element should \{{Use "aria-activedescendant" }}attribute to determine the active option. This attribute uses the "id" of the active option.&#xd;
&#xd;
On the parent &lt;ul> containing the list of options, use role="listbox". On the child &lt;li> elements, use role="option". As well, use aria-selected attribute to programmatically determine the selected option.&#xd;
&#xd;
Alternatively:&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the option names of the combobox are announced by the screen reader along with the focused value and number of results.&#xd;
&#xd;
For instance, when user focuses on first combobox option out of 4 items. It should announce as “option &lt;option name> focused, 1 of 4. 4 results available”.&#xd;
&#xd;
The part of static text i.e “option focused, 1 of 4. 4 results available.” coming from live region and in &lt;span> element should be updated with option name programmatically according to user interaction with this combobox options.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An incomplete user information is announced by the screen reader.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open Jira DC instance.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the header section, activate the "Issues" control, and open any issue.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "Add comment" control and activate it.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the "Comment" field and type "AT" symbol.&#xd;
 # Using the "Down Arrow" key, navigate through the list of names.&#xd;
 # Observe that only the user’s name is announced, but the complete user information is not.&#xd;
&#xd;

[^Mention Announcement Screen Recording.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate to the "Comment" field and type the "@" symbol to trigger the "Mention" dropdown, incomplete information about the users is announced. The screen reader only announces the provided username (e.g., "Chirag2025") instead of the complete user information, such as the "display name", "email address", and "username", which are visible to sighted users.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are unable to access the full information.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that complete user information is conveyed to screen reader users.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this case, make sure to add the "Display Name" and "Email Address" information to the accessible name list so screen reader users can access this information and differentiate between users, rather than relying solely on the provided usernames.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, specify the information in the accessible name list as "Chirag Goyal chirag.goyal@test.com", "John Smith john.smith@test.com", etc. This will help screen reader users access the complete information.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If the new multithreaded index catch-up feature introduced in [JRASERVER-76237: Index catch-up of Comments and Worklogs isn't multi-threaded during Jira startup|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-76237] encounters comment versions or worklogs versions without corresponding rows in the *jiraaction* table, it can fail and trigger a full reindex, significantly prolonging node startup times.&#xd;
&#xd;
If full reindexing on startup is disabled the situation is even worse - Jira will mark the node startup as failed, causing other services such as the task scheduler not to start. Subsequently running a full reindex does not improve this situation; when the node is restarted to bring up the task scheduler, the index catch-up will run again and fail again. This has particularly severe consequences during a non-ZDU upgrade when all nodes have been shut down, and the first node to start fails to recover the index.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up a clustered Jira environment with two nodes.&#xd;
 # Stop node 2.&#xd;
 # Add the startup parameter *-Dcom.atlassian.jira.startup.allow.full.reindex=false* to node 2.&#xd;
 # Log into node 1 and create a new Jira issue.&#xd;
 # Add a comment to the newly created Jira issue.&#xd;
 # Immediately run the following SQL query on the Jira database:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
DELETE FROM jiraaction WHERE id = (SELECT MAX(comment_id) FROM comment_version);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Repeat steps 5 and 6 ten times.&#xd;
 # Start node 2.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira should recover its index on startup normally.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira fails to recover its index. If full reindexing on startup has been disabled, the Jira node will then fail to start:&#xd;

DELETE cv FROM comment_version cv LEFT JOIN jiraaction ja ON cv.comment_id = ja.id JOIN jiraissue ji ON cv.parent_issue_id = ji.id WHERE cv.deleted = 'N' AND ja.id IS NULL AND (ji.archived IS NULL OR ji.archived != 'Y');&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h4. PostgreSQL / Oracle&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
DELETE FROM comment_version WHERE comment_id IN (SELECT cv.comment_id FROM comment_version cv LEFT JOIN jiraaction ja ON cv.comment_id = ja.id JOIN jiraissue ji ON cv.parent_issue_id = ji.id WHERE cv.deleted = 'N' AND ja.id IS NULL AND (ji.archived IS NULL OR ji.archived != 'Y'));&#xd;

The comment delete action doesn't show in the ticket history though, because - why would it?&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: YES&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install any Jira version 9.17 or later.&#xd;
 # Navigate to any dashboard.&#xd;
 # Add multiple Rich Text gadgets with different text content in their bodies.&#xd;
 # Attempt to interact with the gadgets by double-clicking the gadget bar, moving positions, expanding/minimizing, etc.&#xd;
 # Observe the random malfunctioning behavior, where text content fails to render correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Each Rich Text gadget should display its respective content independently and correctly without interference from other gadgets.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The rendering of the Rich Text gadgets malfunctions, leading to the first gadget potentially being overlaid with the second gadget's information.&#xd;
&#xd;
The behavior is random, and gadgets may fail to render the text.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In the recent versions of Jira v10.3.X and above, the vertical scroll bar in “Configure fields” on “edit issue" screen is missing. This limits the visibility of number of customfields available in the instance to short list of 28-30 entries (max).&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Assuming your system is set up with many - probably custom - fields (see System Requirements note below).&#xd;
 # Access any issue from GUI (see System Requirements note below).&#xd;
 # Click on Edit Issue.&#xd;
 # Click on configure fields → Select “Custom Fields” or “All Fields”.&#xd;
 # No scroll bar is present.&#xd;
 # {*}+Note+{*}: Scroll bar is present if you resize the browser Window.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. System Requirements&#xd;
&#xd;
This only happens when there are lots of fields present when trying to "configure fields" as detailed below - maybe over 30 fields are required.&#xd;
&#xd;
It also only happens when the browser window isn't quite large enough to accommodate all the fields that should be shown when attempting to "configure fields".&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The vertical scroll bar is present when using "configure fields" on edit issue screen. This should help users to view all the customfields available in the instance.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 - The vertical scroll bar is missing under both filter conditions: “Custom Fields” or “All -Fields”.&#xd;
 - This actually limits the number of customfield visibility to only 28-30 entries (max) and rest of the customfields are not visible/selectable for users. This will be problematic for instances with large number of fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Change the size of the browser window whilst the "configure fields" dialog is present.&#xd;
&#xd;
One way of doing this is to open the "Developer Tools" option within the browser page (not in a separate window) and select the "Network" option. This will enable the option to view the scroll bar and you can make changes as required. *OR* use the standard (create, edit) issue screen configuration pages to make changes for respective issue types in the system.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) You can minimize the developer tools section (after opening) to perform the operations.</description><createDate>2025-02-18T10:38:21.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Jira logs excessive warnings regarding form parameters and servlets, need fix for Platform 7</summary><key>JRASERVER-78601</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-78601</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Many parts of Jira put excessive log messages into the log files regarding form parameters, and servlets. Most prominently, this can be seen when logging in through the login gadget on the dashboard. This was fixed earlier using [-JRASERVER-30406-|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30406] by adding the below lines in logging.properties&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
# Suppress log spam about the request body - https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30406&#xd;
com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.level = SEVERE&#xd;
com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.filterFormParameters.level = SEVERE {code}&#xd;
Now with the Platform 7 update that included the Jersey update (JAX-RS 2) as mentioned in the [release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-10-0-x-release-notes-1416825224.html%C2%A0] the package seem to have migrated from {{{}com.sun.jersey (Jersey 1.x){}}}to {{org.glassfish.jersey(Jersey 2.x)}}&#xd;
{quote}These changes will only impact Marketplace partners who develop apps. The underlying libraries, Jackson and Jersey, have been upgraded to the latest versions. REST v2 also makes use of JAX-RS 2. [Check out the REST v2 migration guide|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-rest/src/8.0.x/UPGRADE_720.md]&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Hence, the old fix does not seem to be working for Jira 10 and above. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Log out of Jira&#xd;
 # Visit the System Dashboard&#xd;
 # Log in to Jira&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Accessing '{*}System Info{*}' option from the Systems menu throws "{*}403 - Forbidden{*}" errors for the users having Jira Administrator privileges while it works properly for users with Jira System Administrator privileges.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, this works well for both roles Jira Administrator, Jira System Administrator privileges in the older versions.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install Jira Software Version 10.3.0 or higher.&#xd;
 # Create 2 user accounts one with '{*}Jira Administrator{*}' and 'another one with {*}Jira System Administrator{*}' privileges.&#xd;
 # Login as user with user with '{*}Jira Administrator{*}' privileges.&#xd;
 # Access the administration option and navigate to '{*}System --> System Info{*}' option.&#xd;
 # Repeat the same for user with {*}Jira System Administrator{*}' privileges.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
As described in this KB article [Managing global permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-global-permissions-938847142.html] - ideally only users with Jira System Administrator privileges should be able to view or manage tasks from the the Systems menu. However it works both both roles in the older versions (tested for multiple versions in 9.12.X).&#xd;
&#xd;
If there are no specific restrictions implemented in 10.X versions  - then users under both roles '{*}Jira Administrator{*}' and '{*}Jira System Administrator{*}' should be able to view or manage tasks from the the Systems menu.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Users with *'Jira Administrator'* role privileges can access the Systems menu. However, accessing the System Info option throws "403 - Forbidden" error in GUI.&#xd;
&#xd;
Other options like monitoring, clean-up, audit logs are accessible for both roles.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When uploading, or changing manually, the look and feel text colors to white. Some text items in Jira menu become invisible (but still functional).&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug is an extension of JRASERVER-77608, the differences will be placed below.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open Administration menu and go to Look and Feel menu&#xd;
 # Upload a *RED* logo with a white (tested with black logos and failed)&#xd;
(i) Alternatively can change the "Header navigation - highlight text color", "Drop-down menu item - text color" and "Primary button - text color" to white (#ffffff), but the main idea is to use the logo upload&#xd;
 # Open the project settings and observe the issue type, or open an issue search in advanced and start typing&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All items are visible.&#xd;

&#xd;
For Jira 10.3.0 this change heavily affect Jira, severe compromising Jira colors (as the JRASERVER-77608).&#xd;
&#xd;
For Jira 10.3.1 and later, it affects only a few items, such as the issue types in project settings, and the autocomplete data in issue search (in both cases the text is blank in a blank background).&#xd;

The #0B66E4 color alone is used to identify the "Atlassian End User Agreement", "Apache Software Foundation", "org.jclarion:image4j:0.7:jar" and so on links in the "Atlassian Jira and Jira Plugins" modal dialog that becomes available on activating the "Help" and "About Jira" buttons in the header section.&#xd;
&#xd;
The mentioned links have a low contrast ratio of 2.7:1 with the surrounding text.&#xd;
&#xd;
This will make it difficult for low-vision users and those with color blindness to distinguish the links within the block of text.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Users should be able to easily identify the links within the block of text.&#xd;
&#xd;
To make it easy for all users to recognize links the best practice is to persistently underline them or provide any other visual cue such as formatting the text as bold or italic. If the above solution is not feasible, change the color of the link so that they have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the surrounding text.&#xd;
&#xd;
Moreover, it is best practice to ensure that the underline appears not only when the mouse is hovered over the link but also when the link receives the keyboard focus.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The #0B66E4 color alone is used to identify the "Disable Keyboard Shortcuts" link in the "Keyboard Shortcuts" modal dialog that becomes available on activating the "Help" and "Keyboard Shortcuts" buttons in the header section.&#xd;
&#xd;
The mentioned link has a low contrast ratio of 2.7:1 with the surrounding text.&#xd;
&#xd;
This will make it difficult for low-vision users and those with color blindness to distinguish the link within the block of text.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Users should be able to easily identify the link within the block of text.&#xd;
&#xd;
To make it easy for all users to recognize links the best practice is to persistently underline them or provide any other visual cue such as formatting the text as bold or italic. If the above solution is not feasible, change the color of the link so that they have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the surrounding text.&#xd;
&#xd;
Moreover, it is best practice to ensure that the underline appears not only when the mouse is hovered over the link but also when the link receives the keyboard focus.&#xd;

Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;

&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There are adjacent image and textual links such as "Jira DC VPAT 2025" which point to the same destination but are defined in separate &lt;a> tags. Also the alternate text of the image link is same as the text of the textual link. As a result, screen reader users are presented with a repeated information of link which opens the same page.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Image and text links with same destination should be merged into a single link.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the image and text link that point to the same destination are combined into a single link as a link block.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes:&#xd;
 * Define the image and the link text within a single &lt;a> element instead of separate &lt;a> elements.&#xd;
 * Ideally alternate text must be provided to all image links using the "alt" attribute. In this instance, since the image and the textual link point to an identical destination page, use an empty ‘alt’ attribute. &#xd;
 * Use CSS if necessary to maintain the presentation of the content.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Recently the ticket https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30128 was fixed for Jira Cloud, allowing users to use period or comma separators when logging time and still logged the time correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example: Logging 1,5h and 1.5h will log the same time in Cloud, whereas depending on the language settings in your profile for DC, this can cause 1,5h to log as 15hours instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Set User language to English&#xd;
# Create issue on Jira&#xd;
# Log 1,5h and see 15h logged&#xd;
# Log 1.5h and see 1.5h logged&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Jira should log time regardless of separator used.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Depending on user language settings, Jira will ignore the separator used and log time incorrectly.&#xd;

Please have a look at it.</text><author>Jan Schweiger</author></comments><comments><text>Thank you [~7550ef5838c5] for creating this ticket, after having discussed this problem over support.  :)&#xd;
&#xd;
In order to let your development besser assess and understand impact, I'll comment here what I explained you in the support ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
I hope that this bug will get high prioritization, since this is a very common and severe issue, especially in Europe and in project business.&#xd;
&#xd;
Let’s figure it out that one has a work package with 10 activities. At the end, a bill will be issued to the customer basing on the time bookings in Jira. Each hour costs the customer 100€.&#xd;
&#xd;
For each activity 7.5 hours are spent (total: 75 hours, 7,500€).&#xd;
&#xd;
However, a user logs for one of those activities 7,5 hours. Since this person uses Jira in English, this time will be logged by Jira as 75 hours. The total of hours will be in this case 142.5 instead of 75, and the customer will be issued a bill of 14,250€ instead of 7,500€. Almost twice as much.&#xd;
&#xd;
I think that none of us would like to be that customer. !https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/standard/caa27a19-fc09-4452-b2b4-a301552fd69c/32x32/1f642.png|width=20,height=20!</text><author>Manuel Marinucci</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Jira 10 forcibly decodes encoded ASCII characters in webhook URLs</summary><key>JRASERVER-78312</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-78312</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>*Issue Summary:*&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira 10, webhooks do not preserve URL encoding after being triggered, causing potential failures in processing by external services.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to Reproduce:*&#xd;
 * Upgrade to, or performa clean installation of, Jira 10.0.0&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Configure a webhook with a URL containing the %3D characters.&#xd;
Example:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://webhook.site/87749b79-cde2-4add-91da-4538b46f01ec/TOKEN=%3D {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Trigger the webhook to send a request.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Expected Results:*&#xd;
&#xd;
The webhook request should preserve URL encoding in the query parameters, resulting in a correctly formatted URL:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
POST /87749b79-cde2-4add-91da-4538b46f01ec/TOKEN=%3D?{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
*Actual Results:*&#xd;
In Jira 10.0.0 and later, the webhook request does not preserve URL encoding, resulting in an incorrect URL:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
POST /87749b79-cde2-4add-91da-4538b46f01ec/TOKEN== HTTP/1.1&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
*Impact:*&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug affects the functionality of webhooks that rely on special characters being URL-encoded, potentially leading to authentication failures and disruptions in integrations with external services.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround:*&#xd;
&#xd;
Try one of the following workarounds to address the issue:&#xd;
&#xd;
1. *Secure admin webhooks:* Use this feature to avoid passing security tokens via URLs.&#xd;
2. *Re-generate tokens:* Generate new tokens until they don't contain problematic characters like `%3D`.&#xd;
3. *Outbound HTTP/S proxy:* Use a network proxy to re-write webhook URLs for proper encoding.&#xd;
&#xd;
These options provide temporary solutions until a permanent fix is available.</description><createDate>2024-12-05T23:59:22.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>FYI, this behavior also manifests in 10.3.1 and 10.4.0.</text><author>Dave Liao (Braze)</author></comments><comments><text>Any estimate on when a fix will be available to end users?

h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate to the "Details" section using the "Down Arrow" key and try to interact with the custom fields, such as "Test", "Demo", and so on, these fields are not rendered for them. The screen reader's focus skips these fields and directly moves to the "Description" section. This occurs because role="application" is inappropriately specified for the &lt;div> element containing the custom fields section.&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are unable to interact with the custom fields.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the screen reader users can navigate through the custom fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this scenario, remove the role="application" from the source of the &lt;div> element.&#xd;

Maybe the ticket needs to be reopened?&#xd;
&#xd;
I'm disappointed that you guys couldn't work this out internally – that I have to be the one to give a second recording of the same problem. Don't you all have an accessibility team, the ones that already recreated this problem and posted the existing video? I'm also disappointed in the generally poor accessibility across JIRA.</text><author>bradcaugust</author></comments><comments><text>I agree with Bradley that I don't understand why you are having so much trouble reproducing this since your own Accessibility team was able to.  The attached recording, made by that team, clearly shows the screen reader jumping past the field called "Chirag".  In addition to not reading the fields while iterating through, it also prevents NVDA from being able to search for values within the custom fields section.&#xd;
&#xd;
The fix, which I think is detailed on the original support ticket (A11Y-954), is to remove *role="application"* from the *&lt;div>* that surrounds the custom fields.  It's a simple fix that I've already implemented in my own environment by injecting some extra JavaScript into the page, but screen reader users elsewhere could really benefit from this very simple change on your end.</text><author>David Dunham</author></comments><comments><text>My recording, if I'm able to upload it at some point, is recreating the problem on this very ticket. NVDA can't get into the below custom fields. It just reads "Application space", and doesn't say any of the things inside. So it goes from the labels to Description with only "Application space" in between. It doesn't read those fields and you can't search for them either.&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
During the import of new data Jira doesn't assign a version to issue and comment entities , during the reindexation it expects that all the entities have versions since all the data will come from :&#xd;
 * XML restore (Cloud backup) where UpgradeTask_Build900000 will populate the tables&#xd;
 * Or the current data was already processed by the upgrade task&#xd;
Therefore during the reindexation It does not bump the version or generate it instead the following warning is thrown because the newly inserted data does not have a version.&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a sample software project issues with template.&#xd;
 # Navigate to Manage filters and open the board filter. For example, "{*}Filter for SCRUM board{*}"&#xd;
 # Click Basic and then switch to Advanced. Then, click *Search* button.&#xd;

 # Go to issue search in Advanced mode&#xd;
 # Enter as JQL: project = ABC (key or name of an existing project)&#xd;

 # In Basic Mode, add another selection, for example a Type or Status&#xd;
 # Switch to Advanced mode&#xd;
 # (hopefully) recognize that the project key or name was replaced by the project id&#xd;

This behaviour is very bad because, as a consequence of this behaviour on a board filter, the board disappears from the project, and people think the board was deleted.&#xd;
People knowing this bug might rechange the JQL to get the board back into the project, but others are helpless and won't have this idea.</text><author>Gisela Lassahn</author></comments><comments><text>As mentioned by [~b079375df230] we experienced the same problem.

Issue Summary&#xd;
Creating comments using CommentManager without dispatching an event resulting in comments without an entity version&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a comment using [this method|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/9.12.7/index.html?com/atlassian/jira/issue/comments/CommentManager.html]. Set {{dispatchEvent}} to false.&#xd;
#* Example code&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
import com.atlassian.jira.component.ComponentAccessor&#xd;
import com.atlassian.jira.util.json.JSONObject&#xd;
&#xd;
final boolean dispatchEvent = false&#xd;
def issueManager = ComponentAccessor.getIssueManager()&#xd;
def commentManager = ComponentAccessor.getCommentManager()&#xd;
def issue = issueManager.getIssueObject("TASK-1")&#xd;
&#xd;
commentManager.create(issue, "JIRAUSER10000", "This is a comment created using JAVA API dispatchEvent = false", dispatchEvent)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 # Verify if the comment is created successfully by browsing the issue.&#xd;
 # Check the atlassian-jira.log for any warning messages about the new comment.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* The comment is created successfully with a row inserted into the {{jiraaction}} database table for the comment and a corresponding row in the {{comment_version}} table&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The comment is created successfully. However, the below exception may be seen repetitively in the atlasian-jira.log file:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
2024-06-07 11:26:10,949+0200 NodeReindexServiceThread:thread-0 WARN      [c.a.j.issue.index.DefaultIssueIndexer] COMMENT with id=5253545 should have a version by now&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The SQL query below checks for comments without a version in the database. The comments added with the example above show up in the SQL result.&#xd;
{code:SQL}&#xd;
select * from jiraaction WHERE actiontype = 'comment'&#xd;
AND id not in (select comment_id from comment_version);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) Despite without an entity version, this doesn’t affect the index search functionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
* Reindexing the comments using Java API [reIndexComments|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/9.12.7/com/atlassian/jira/issue/index/IssueIndexingService.html#reIndexComments-java.util.Collection-]&#xd;
* Manually inserting a row into the {{comment_version}} table. Example row:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
comment_id|parent_issue_id|update_time                  |index_version|deleted|&#xd;

{code}&#xd;
(i) The value of {{comment_id}} and {{parent_issue_id}} can be retrieved from the {{jiraaction}} table using the previous query to identify the "version-less comments".&#xd;
{{update_time}} is usually the current time.&#xd;
{{index_version}} should be 1 (as a workaround for this bug).&#xd;

&#xd;
user search in the reporter field not working as expected if the *com.atlassian.jira.ignoreBrowseUsersPermissionsInUserPickers.disabled* dark feature disabled&#xd;
&#xd;
This was reproduced in 5.12.4&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Integrate jira with Active Directory/LDAP&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Within Jira if you are trying to change the reporter of an issue, if you select the reporter drop down and start typing to filter the list, if you include a space or a period the results will be empty even though there should be matching hits.  &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a user with a full name that includes a space.  For example "FirstName LastName" along with an email of "first.last". &#xd;
# Navigate to an issue and select the reporter drop down&#xd;
# Start typing to filter the list.  Type in "FirstName".  Notice you should see the list including the user you created.  &#xd;
# Add then type to search "FirstName l".  Notice the list results will drop to 0.  This is somewhat inconsistent but happens more often than not.   &#xd;
# Next search for "first.".  Notice as soon as the "." is added the results drop to zero even though it should match on the email address.  This is always occurring.  &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The search should return the filtered users if there is a space or a period in the search term.  &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
If there is a space or period in the search query the resulting user list will no longer be returned.  &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.  However if you do not include the "." or the "space" character in the search the results will appear based on the stem word.  &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira redirects the users back to the login page when SSO is used with Crowd (when *SSOSeraphAuthenticator* is enabled in the {*}seraph-config.xml{*}. It works fine when Crowd is not used (when *JiraSeraphAuthenticator* is enabled.)&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Jira 9.12.4 and Crowd 5.2.3 environment&#xd;
 # Configure Crowd by adding the Jira application&#xd;
 # Add Crowd directory in Jira&#xd;
 # Configure SSO in Jira by using Jira's SSO application&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario-1:*&#xd;
 - If an image attachment is entered (either by copy-pasting it or by drag-n-drop) into the comment field during a transition where only comment field is available then this image attachment is not shown properly after saving but only the placeholder is there. Users will get an popup with error message on the screen appears for very short interval and often users might miss this.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Adding attachment is not supported for this screen&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 - However, even the image attachment is clearly visible in comment dialog when changes are made and effect is only on saving the comment (screenshots added).&#xd;
&#xd;
 - If a transition screen has both (attachment and comment) fields, then it is possible to add attachment into the comment field and it is shown properly.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario-2:*&#xd;
 - Attachments option in the comments part (+) icon allows users to only add screenshots/attachments which are already in the request and not external attachments.&#xd;
&#xd;
 - When no attachments are already added, on clicking (+) icon it disappears.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario-1:*&#xd;
 # Create a screen without any fields (attachments) and save it (please check following [instructions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-add-a-comment-during-a-workflow-transition-and-make-it-mandatory-779160682.html] for transition screen configuration).&#xd;
 # Choose a workflow transition and associate this screen to it.&#xd;
 # Now perform a transition of the issue and this will pop-up comment screen.&#xd;
 # Try to grab some image from local system using drag and drop option, notice there is an error on top right of screen for a moment.&#xd;
 # However, comment field clearly shows the screenshot. Try to save it and observe the results, it will be only be problematic place-holder thumbnail and attachment doesn't get added.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario-2:*&#xd;
 # Make sure to add couple of attachments to the ticket.&#xd;
 # In the same context above for Step-4, perform the transition which should pop-up a comment screen. Now click on (+) icon and observe changes.&#xd;
 # You will only be able to add existing attachments within the ticket and can't fetch from local system or externally.&#xd;
 # Now delete the attachments from the ticket and once again try above step.&#xd;
 # You will not be able to add any attachments and the (+) icon disappears.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 - System should allow the users to add screenshots during transitions without mandating the attachment field to be added to the screens. This will help users to avoid some redundant efforts when working with large set of workflows.&#xd;
&#xd;
 - System should also users to add external attachments as compared to allowing only attachments within the ticket, otherwise they will be simply duplicates.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 - System doesn't allow adding comments in transitions without attachment field configured in the screens.&#xd;
&#xd;
 - System doesn't allow users to add any external attachments and if there are no already existing attachments, then (+) icon disappears on clicking. It should at-least give a fair message to users if this is not possible or supported.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure to add '{*}Attachments{*}' field to the transitions where you would prefer to add attachments and screenshots. Otherwise, system will not support this operation.</description><createDate>2024-03-08T13:15:54.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Similar bug ticket JSWSERVER-20625 &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
JSM Agents might not see all expected requests when doing a JQL search where they are the reporter if requests have an issue security level without the Reporter role added. This appears to be intermittent and possibly caused by caching issues/automations.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Service Management project&#xd;
 # Create an issue security scheme and an issue security level.&#xd;
 # Set up an Automation rule to set the security level on issue create&#xd;
 # Add *Service project customer - portal access* to this security level, but do not add any role which would allow the Agent to see the issue in Jira.&#xd;
 # As an Agent, create some requests from the Customer portal&#xd;
 # View the My Requests in the Customer portal&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Agent should be able to see all requests they created via Customer portal and not see them within Jira search.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Sometimes, these requests are not visible on the My requests/All requests page.&#xd;
&#xd;
There's no error anywhere in the UI or logs, the requests are just not visible but they can be accessed via the direct URL, which indicates that there's no permission issue with at least viewing the request.&#xd;
&#xd;
Modifying the security levels in any way seems to show the issues temporarily.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Add Reporter to the security level</description><createDate>2023-10-09T13:44:58.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The workaround of adding the Reporter to the security level isn't viable as we don't want to give them access to issues they shouldn't be able to access as an agent.

Issue Security is required to keep confidentiality of issues they shouldn't be able to see.</text><author>Todd Thomas</author></comments><comments><text>It looks like it’s hard to gather interest or to understand the impact as there are several issues, if fixed, would solve most if not all of these issues.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: no, though regularly affecting customers&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create an Issue during some excessive load in Jira, like Full GCs, DB connection overload, etc&#xd;
 # Observe the Issue will lack the Status transition buttons&#xd;
&#xd;
This has also been observed when the Issue's created but unable to be reindexed (like JRASERVER-74514).&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 # The Issue would either fail to be created or be sucessfully created and have the Status transition buttons available&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
(?) Is it possible to have the os_wfentry.state be initialized with 1 instead of 0?&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 # The Issue's created (possibly not indexed) and is missing the Status transition buttons&#xd;
&#xd;
The Issue's first created with a os_wfentry.state of 0, _then_ it's updated to 1. This happens outside a DB transaction, so an interruption may lead to the os_wfentry record being left in an invalid state = 0.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Wither run the Database Integrity Checker or manually update the Issues with state = 0 to state = 1 on the os_wfentry table, as described in:&#xd;
 * [Workflow transition button missing from the issue view page in Jira server|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=800304645]&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
----&#xd;
 &#xd;
This is impacting customers in a way they have to deal with this right after dealing with the initial degradation or outage that causes the Issues to be created in an invalid state.&#xd;
&#xd;
This also impacts end-users directly and being unable to transition Issues tends to escalate quickly across their companies.</description><createDate>2023-12-18T15:08:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We are facing this issue frequently in our Jira datacenter application (Fidelity) and we would like to get this addressed with priority. 200-500+ issues face this issue every month and the workaround via database update cannot be performed frequently and it is not preferred</text><author>Vishwanaath Gopalakrishnan</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>The option to "Send email" is currently not adhering to the configured "Email from" settings and displaying the username instead of the full name.</summary><key>JRASERVER-76778</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-76778</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

*Scenario 1*&#xd;
 # Install Jira with Microsoft SQL as the database&#xd;
 # Navigate to *Administration » System » General Configuration* and set the System Timezone to *America / Chicago*&#xd;
 # Set your user's timezone to Chicago&#xd;
 # Add a version with a release date to a project.&#xd;
 # Change profile time zone to New York and check on the release to see it is now a day behind &#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 2*&#xd;
 # Install Jira with PostgreSQL as the database&#xd;
 # Navigate to *Administration » System » General Configuration* and set the System Timezone to *GMT OffSet* and choose "GMT-7"&#xd;
 # Add a version with a release date to a project.&#xd;
 # The release date is behind 1 day.&#xd;
 # Changing the user profile to the same as the System Timezone. The release date still behind 1 day. Also, it does not honour the user profile timezone changes.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Release dates do not change when changing profile &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The date changes to the day prior &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario 1:*&#xd;
 * Set the timezone of every user to match the Jira default &#xd;
&#xd;
*Scenario2:*&#xd;
 * Set the *Default user time zone* back to the *System Default timezone* (the same timezone matching with the *jvm.system.timezone* ) via {*}Administration > General Configuration > Edit settings{*}.&#xd;
(i) You can find the timezone for "jvm.system.timezone" via {*}Administration > System Info{*}.</description><createDate>2023-10-25T14:41:07.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>It could be related to the way the database returns dates.

My test set the "Release Date" for a Version to be "15/Dec/23" (aka 15-Dec-2023). The following Smart Value results were observed when reading and formatting that value in an Automation Rule:&#xd;

Jira is stripping the time from the ISO 8601 format and treating it as midnight in the Jira default time zone resulting in this bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
An example is an EST time zone default Jira server where other users may be in the CST time zone. Since CST is 1 hour behind EST and Jira strips the time and defaults to midnight in the default time zone, it then results in the previous day at 11PM for CST users.&#xd;

According to the fixed bug [JSWSERVER-20133|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-20133], and the [associated developer announcement|https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/announcement-changes-to-lucene-indexing/31738], fields that exceed the limit of 32766 bytes will be removed before they are committed to Lucene. It appears the intention is to raise an ERROR upon such attempts to warn the plugin developer, but the index should be otherwise unaffected.&#xd;

However, there is evidence Jira tries to commit the data to Lucene, causing a failure mode.&#xd;

It does result in the failures flowing upward to the calling method:&#xd;
 * The full reindex is marked as failed&#xd;
 ** Although mitigated partially via [JRASERVER-72235|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-72235]&#xd;
 * Index recovery "catch up" phase is marked as failed and thus triggers a full reindex, see [JRASERVER-76391|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-76391]&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * See replication steps in [JRASERVER-76391|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-76391]&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * The message {{A document contained a potential immense term in field customfield_10220_timeline. The field has been removed from the document.}} is logged&#xd;
 * No further errors are logged. The indexing proceeds normally. Possibly - the issue is not marked as failed.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * org.apache.lucene.util.BytesRefHash$MaxBytesLengthExceededException is raised&#xd;
 * The issue is marked as failed&#xd;
 * The failure flows upward to the parent method (full reindex, index recovery, etc)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 - Check the remotelink table to get the entries with length (url)  by executing below mentioned query:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
select length (url), * from remotelink r order by length (url) desc {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 - Observe the url length for the top most record. You can match the same number in the error message mentioned in Issue Summary field.&#xd;
 - The data extracted from remotelink table has issueid column.&#xd;
 - Export the issue details in CSV to have backup of the issue.&#xd;
 - Delete the issue from User interface&#xd;
 - Restart the instance and observe if the issue is fixed.</description><createDate>2023-10-17T03:28:01.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Full reindex fails in the current LTS? That sure seems like more than a Low priority to me!&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Index recovery unhelpfully triggers a full lock reindex if an issue in the index catchup phase fails to index. &#xd;
&#xd;
For example, the implementation of [JSWSERVER-20133|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-20133] results in the issue containing the immense value to be marked as failed. &#xd;
&#xd;
During a full reindex, the reindex will "complete" to 100%, despite individual failures. During index recovery during node startup, the catch up process will also sustain individual failures, however, the catch-up process will be deemed failed and the node will then proceed to performing a full lock reindex. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is unhelpful because the node startup will be delayed, potentially for a very long time, and, the full reindex will also fail to index these issues - the underlying problem is not fixed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Enterprise Jira instance could take 24 hours or longer to perform full lock reindex. Startup is often a sensitive time for Jira Administrators. While other nodes may be typically online to mitigate the impact, this is not guaranteed, for example, environment failover, environment restore, etc.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Configure a 2 node Jira v9.4.8 cluster. Have 1 node started, the other stopped. &#xd;
# Add an issue with some sample data&#xd;
# Perform a scheduled Jira snapshot to create a snapshot in shared_home&#xd;
# Insert a customfield value over the UTF8 encoding limit of 32766 (we inserted a checklist item via [Checklist for Jira v6.2.5|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211562/checklist-for-jira/version-history] to do this)&#xd;
# Delete Node 2's local index, then start the node&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Node 2 starts and initiates the index recovery procedure, picking the snapshot in shared_home&#xd;
* The index catch up phase executes, but the issue with the immense term fails to index. &#xd;
* An warning is logged for the admin, but the startup continues&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* Node 2 starts and initiates the index recovery procedure, picking the snapshot in shared_home&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h4. a. Override functionality&#xd;
To prevent an automatic Full Reindex upon a failure to restore an Index Snapshot, this Opt can be set o Jira's startup ([Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=938847831]):&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
-Dcom.atlassian.jira.startup.allow.full.reindex=false&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
If the node can't recover it's own local Indexes up to date, Admins can "copy Index from another node" though the UI. Keep in mind a proxy bypass Tomcat connector is needed to access a node wihtout a valid Index, as it'll report unavailable to the Load Balancer ([Bypass a proxy or SSL to test network connectivity for Jira server|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=827328189]).&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. b. Cleanup Index Snapshots&#xd;
The cause for the Index Snapshot retrieval can also be investigated, and one of the causes customers have seen is corrupted Index Snapshots on the shared home (disk space failure's usually a cause of this).&#xd;
Admins may delete the most recent Index Snapshot if its size is suspiciously lower than the previous Snapshots.&#xd;
For example, this issue [JRASERVER-74637|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-74637] has lead to disk space depletion and resulted in corrupted Snapshots on he shared home, cascading into _this_ issue [JRASERVER-76391|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-76391].&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) &#xd;
&#xd;
When the customer raises a support request using Jira's UI there is the option to attach a support.zip.&#xd;
&#xd;
This support.zip comes to GSAC empty, we always investigate the case and ask the support.zip if that's a good next step.&#xd;
&#xd;
If this was intentional to avoid us receiving too many unnecessary attachments, this option should be removed, or corrected to actually include the support files.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to Administration > System > Troubleshooting and support tools > Get help > Contact Technical Support or Report a Bug&#xd;
 # Tick the "Attach support.zip" checkbox&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The support.zip is created and added to the ticket on our GSAC side.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The ticket is created with an "empty" support.zip making us start the assistance without application information, sometimes "burning" the first response asking for this file.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When accessing Jira within a VM such as Citrix, RDP, or a VDI. If you click on view workflow from the issue view, it causes the workflow popup to render off centre, with the close button appearing off screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you close this popup, and open it a second time, then the workflow popup will draw correctly&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Access Jira from within a VM/VDI&#xd;
# Go to the issue view&#xd;
# Click View Workflow&#xd;
# Experience the workflow window being off centre&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Workflow should render correctly in the middle of the screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Workflow renders to the right of the screen, with the close button not being visible.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally the following error will appear regardless of zoom level&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
The workflow designer may not behave correctly at your current browser zoom level, press ⌘ + 0 to reset it.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Close the workflow after opening, and then open the view workflow again without refreshing the screen.&#xd;
If the size of the windows is still small (wide but “low”) you can use CTRL+ to make the window bigger and the +- signs to the left to size the workflow to make it readable.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
On browsers where cache is disabled, users can encounter inoperative mentions and comment creation. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue can't be consistently reproduced. However, we've been able to reproduce it by doing the following:&#xd;
# Navigate to an issue view page, or go to *Issues*>*Search for Issues* (detail view)&#xd;
# Launch the Chrome Dev Tools (right-click > *inspect element*)&#xd;
# Switch to the *Network* tab and check *disable cache*, select Fast /Good 3G as bandwidth limit (throttling)&#xd;
# Switch to the *Console* and type *wiki-edit* in filter to catch the error.&#xd;
# Hard-refresh the page (ctrl [Windows] / cmd [Mac] + shift + r)&#xd;
# Click the pencil icon next to the description box.&#xd;
# Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the bug occurs (every time the error is shown in the Console tab).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The rich text editor loads with the existing content and is editable.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The rich text editor opens, but existing content is missing. The text insertion cursor does not appear while hovering over the body. The controls (style, bold, italics, etc.) are greyed out and show a loading icon when hovering.&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the browser's console:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Error: jira/mention/mention missing wiki-edit/api{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that your browser cache is not disabled and bandwidth limited. Refreshing the page should resolve the issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, monitor network bandwidth and check if the problem is generated when the speed slows down. </description><createDate>2023-04-26T12:13:03.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>we seem to have the same issue with Jira 9.8.1.

Thanks for sharing your findings and providing feedback. Based on the evidence I reviewed from affected customers, your symptoms match the bug. Upon further review, we discovered the bug resulted from a [race condition|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition] – which explains why it only occurs intermittently. We updated the _fix version_ field on May 29th to indicate the hotfix was included with Jira Server/DC 9.9.0.

&#xd;
After investigation, we have confirmed that the previously reported issue has been resolved as of version 9.4.6. Tests conducted after the Jira upgrade showed no recurrence of the exception {{{}Error: jira/mention/mention missing wiki-edit/api{}}}.&#xd;
However, similar errors identified post-update appear to be influenced by third-party plugins&#xd;
&#xd;
Customers experiencing related issues should attempt to run Jira in safe mode or disable third-party plugins to verify if the issue persists. If the error ceases, it indicates that the cause is external and related to installed plugins.&#xd;
&#xd;
Once again, we will move this ticket to *closed* with a "fixed" resolution.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, if the issue is reencountered, please open a support ticket for further investigation.&#xd;

Quality Engineer</text><author>Patryk Oleksyk</author></comments><comments><text>The issue with @mention problems in Text mode started when we installed XRAY for Jira on 9.4.6 hence this reported issue [https://jira.getxray.app/browse/XRAY-9729] that the vendor has deferred to be an Atlassian issue as they cannot reproduce it in 9.13.x&#xd;
&#xd;
Funny thing is, we are tracking another issue on overall page load/render performance related to batch.js and the Assets plugin for those who have Jira Service Management installed. See [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-15225]&#xd;
&#xd;
Assets though not use in our environment is installed with JSM and after many reproduction efforts seems to be a large batch.js consumer/abuser. The only way to disable Assets is through REST (curl) and results in a small 10-15m outage while Jira disabled the add-on.&#xd;
&#xd;
I did some reproduction efforts before and after disabling Assets with @mentions on text mode and before disable it rarely worked, after it was reproducible, but less often. I think overall this is not any specific application or add-on that is the cause, but an issue with performance in batch.js and the more add-ons that load into their the higher possibility you may encounter this problem with mentions. XRAY and Assets are our biggest offenders in this area.&#xd;
&#xd;
I presume Atlassian made some performance tweaks in 9.13 that reduces the recurrence of this issue, not on purpose perhaps, but sometimes release notes do not tell us the full change history under the hood in code optimizations.&#xd;
&#xd;
So for us, reducing the overall size and impact of batch.js improves the performance of @mentions on text mode. Whether this is 3rd part or 1st party add-ons, the difference is real. </text><author>Casey Hinkle</author></comments><comments><text>Any chance whatever in 9.13 helps with these issue can be backported to an LTS release? 9.12.x perhaps?</text><author>Casey Hinkle</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Archived versions showing inconsistent results between basic and advanced search</summary><key>JRASERVER-74998</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-74998</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;

Filtering by *fix version* or *affects version* suggests inconsistent results between basic search and advanced search. In basic search, archived versions are not suggested or selectable, but are in advanced search.&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira &lt;8.0.0, all versions are suggested and selectable. This bug still exists in Jira 9.7.0.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Do either of these&#xd;
 * Start reindexing of two project concurrently&#xd;
 * Start background and project reindex concurrently&#xd;
 * Start project or background reindex so that it finishes at the time a scheduled snapshot is created&#xd;
 * Archive two projects concurrently&#xd;
 * -Start two nodes concurrently when there's no fresh index snapshot in shared home- &lt;-- Not true, because there's a cluster lock preventing that&#xd;
&#xd;
It has been always possible to create two index snapshots concurrently (full reindex + scheduled), but with recent Jira versions we have started creating snapshots more often.&#xd;
Starting from 9.1.0 we create index snapshots on node start (if a fresh one doesn't exist).&#xd;
Starting from 9.4.1 we create index snapshots after project reindex and project archive.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The minimum number of snapshots is created.&#xd;
The snapshot is a backup of a healthy index.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Multiple snapshots are created concurrently.&#xd;
Each snapshot can contain only part of the healthy index (in case of two project reindexes on two different nodes).&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Only run a second project reindex when the first one finishes.&#xd;
 # Only archive a second project once the index snapshot is created after the first one has been archived (this can only be seen in the logs, search for "{{{}Done creating index snapshot{}}}")&#xd;
 # Do not run project and background reindex at the same time.&#xd;
 # Do not run project or background index around the time the scheduled snapshot is created</description><createDate>2022-12-21T17:00:42.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>What is the impact of multiple snapshots being created at the same time?</text><author>Matt Doar</author></comments><comments><text>[~e6a44563da75] ,&#xd;
&#xd;
It depends on the scenario and whether both reindexes happen on the same node or multiple nodes. The most serious consequence can be that the latest snapshot does not contain the most recent index version. For example, if you change project's configuration and reindex this project while another node is running a background reindex, that background reindex might finish after the project reindex finishes. The snapshot from the background reindex will be considered the most recent, even if it does not reflect that project's configuration change.&#xd;
&#xd;
Another, though less serious, consequence is the additional load on the Jira nodes and the shared home. </text><author>Kamil Cichy</author></comments><comments><text>I believe this has occured for us a few times in the past.

While the issue was happening, you can look at the Clustering page and find a nodes CPU usage at 400-600% but the memory remains the same.&#xd;
&#xd;
I looked at the catalina.out and atlassian-jira.log and found at 12pm for example, catalina.out warns about stuck threads. Then atlassian-jira.log at the same time shows the index snapshot service running.&#xd;
&#xd;
I then decided to check the index snapshots and found 3, 2 minutes apart:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
-rw-r-----. 1 jira jira 3477569197 Feb 26 12:12 IndexSnapshot_18761_240226-121104.tar.sz&#xd;

-rw-r-----. 1 jira jira 3476817647 Feb 26 12:16 IndexSnapshot_18763_240226-121504.tar.sz{code}&#xd;
Not only that, because of the stuck threads on a node, the node becomes unavailable. Then what I think is happening is because the node is stuck, the index snapshot service then kicks off on our second node which also causes stuck threads.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
By default, Jira is set to create a snapshot of indexes daily at 2 AM. However, if this time coincides with when a Lock and Re-index process was just completed in a different node in the cluster, it can break the snapshot task and lead to the instance index entering a deadlocked state, requiring a hard restart of the node index and restoring of a healthy index from a different node. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Execute a Lock and Re-index task in a node in the data center cluster&#xd;
 # When the reindex completes in the node and a different node (which will run the snapshot backup job) identifies that it has been completed, have the snapshot backup job kick in &#xd;
&#xd;
(i) Starting a full reindex while the snapshot job is running also causes this same issue.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira prevents the index from being replaced when a new index is available in the cluster, while the snapshot backup job is running.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira allows both tasks to run simultaneously, leading to "deadlock" scenario where both tasks fails and corrupt that node's index.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Timeline&#xd;
&#xd;
The affected node starts creating a backup of its own index:&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
However, a few seconds later the {{DefaultNodeReindexService}} job identifies that a different node in the cluster has just completed a new re-index and that a new index snapshot is available, so it starts restoring that file:&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
However, while the snapshot backup job is still running, the Index Fixer starts replacing the index files with the new index it received from the other node. For this process, it holds the "stop-the-world" index lock which will prevent any write to the index until that lock is removed by that task:&#xd;
&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
2022-11-09 01:06:00,054+0100 NodeReindexServiceThread:thread-0 INFO      [c.a.j.index.ha.DefaultIndexRecoveryManager] [INDEX-FIXER] Restoring index with 4743369 issues&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
Because the Index Fixer already removed physical files which the snapshot backup job had already mapped while generating the list of files to backup, the snapshot backup job fails to complete:&#xd;
&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
2022-11-09 01:06:01,422+0100 Caesium-1-1 ERROR anonymous    JIRA Index Snapshot Service [c.a.jira.service.ServiceRunner] An error occurred while trying to run service 'JIRA Index Snapshot Service'. java.io.FileNotFoundException: /appl/jira/home/caches/indexesV1/comments/_24jm2_Lucene50_0.tip (No such file or directory)&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
The index fixer process dies after that point, along with the index snapshot backup job. And finally we have the Index Replay failing as well because it's unable to sync the changes the node has been receiving via DBR, given that it can't delete files from the index folder due to the write lock put in place by the snapshot restore process:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h4. *{color:#ff0000}Jira 8.13 notice 🚨{color}*&#xd;
&#xd;
Asynchronous WebHooks have been *enabled by default* on versions:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
8.13.21&#xd;
8.13.22&#xd;
8.13.23&#xd;
8.13.24&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
If you were unaware of this, refer to the *Workaround* section.&#xd;
h4. Asynchronous WebHooks availability&#xd;
&#xd;
Async WebHooks were shipped through JRASERVER-68174 and are fully supported *only* in Jira 8.13, 8.20 and 9.2 onwards following this chart:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
8.13.21 – 8.13.24: Enabled by default and not optimally implemented. Upgrade to 8.13.25 or later when possible.&#xd;
&#xd;
8.13.25 – 8.13.99*: Fully supported&#xd;
8.20.12 – 8.20.99*: Fully supported&#xd;
9.2.0   – 9.99.99*: Fully supported&#xd;
&#xd;
* "hypothetical versions", meaning it's supported on all future releases of that branch.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Enabling asynchronous WebHooks makes use of the Web-Hook-Events-Processor queue, with a *default* Thread pool of *10* processors and maximum queue size of {*}200{*}. This is for {*}each node{*}, and a full queue in "node 1" doesn't route new events to the idle queue in "node 2", for example.&#xd;
&#xd;
In large instances, specially making use of 3rd party SAML/SSO apps, this queue is regularly flooded with too many UserAttributeStoredEvent objects.&#xd;
When the queue reaches it's limit (200 default), it starts *rejecting new events* until it's able to accommodate more. WebHooks listening to events that've been rejected because of full queue won't be triggered.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
 # Setup Jira with SAML/SSO (preferably using a [3rd party app|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?hosting=dataCenter&amp;product=jira&amp;query=saml]).&#xd;
 # Configure some 10 WebHooks to listen to all the events available and do not "Exclude body"&#xd;
 # Setup a JMeter or other request automation to simulate Issue updates, transitions and comment creations.&#xd;
&#xd;
There's suspicion even REST API requests allowlisted to bypass the SAML/SSO will trigger the UserAttributeStoredEvent and flood the queue given enough load.&#xd;
&#xd;
The default queue and/or Thread pool size can be reduced or the Issues being commented, transitioned or updated be populated with lots of data to delay the processors and help reproduce the queue overflow. _(ref.: [How to find the Issues with most data in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-find-the-issues-with-most-data-in-jira-1168848469.html])_&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
Jira's able to handle enterprise-level demand out-of-the-box.&#xd;
Or events that aren't possible for WebHooks to listen to shouldn't be put into the queue to be discarded in sequence.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
Rejected events are observed in atlassian-jira.log:&#xd;
{code:none}&#xd;
2022-10-31 11:46:48,839-0700 http-nio-8080-exec-68 url: /rest/api/2/issue/JIRA-12345/comment; user: charlie ERROR charlie 000x0000000x0 session00 127.0.0.1 /rest/api/2/issue/JIRA-12345/comment [c.a.event.internal.AsynchronousAbleEventDispatcher] There was an exception thrown trying to dispatch event [com.atlassian.jira.event.comment.CommentCreatedEvent@431012fb] from the invoker [SingleParameterMethodListenerInvoker{method=public void com.atlassian.webhooks.plugin.WebHookEventsProcessor.onEvent(java.lang.Object), listener=com.atlassian.webhooks.plugin.WebHookEventsProcessor@1539bc1f}]&#xd;
java.lang.RuntimeException: Task com.atlassian.sal.core.executor.ThreadLocalDelegateRunnable@6a201cb8 rejected from java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@490244d8[Running, pool size = 10, active threads = 10, queued tasks = 200, completed tasks = 2246209]. Listener: com.atlassian.webhooks.plugin.WebHookEventsProcessor event: com.atlassian.jira.event.comment.CommentCreatedEvent&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
We can parse the logs to "group by and count" the events rejected on that queue with this command (Linux):&#xd;
{code:bash}&#xd;
egrep "pool size.*queued tasks.*WebHookEventsProcessor" $JIRA_HOME/log/atlassian-jira.log* | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | column -tx&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Sample output:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
2241  com.atlassian.crowd.event.user.UserAttributeStoredEvent&#xd;
144   com.atlassian.jira.event.issue.IssueEvent&#xd;
15    com.atlassian.jira.event.comment.CommentCreatedEvent&#xd;
7     com.atlassian.jira.event.issue.link.IssueLinkCreatedEvent&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
We see a disproportional amount of *rejected* UserAttributeStoredEvent and also other Event types being rejected (probably as consequence of the flood of the first event type).&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
The workarounds listed here are mutually exclusive: choose one of them. _(though you can implement both, the Feature Flag takes precedence and the pool and queue size as irrelevant)_&#xd;
&#xd;
*(!) Note: The workarounds work for Jira 8.x and 9.x only.*&#xd;
h4. A. Disabling async WebHooks&#xd;
&#xd;
If you're on Jira Core versions 8.13.21–24 or on other Jira 8.20.x or Jira 9.2.x and have enabled the async WebHooks, you may disable it with the Feature Flag below and *restart Jira* (one node at a time will work):&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
com.atlassian.jira.webhookEventsAsyncProcessing.disabled{code}&#xd;
_(ref.: [How to manage dark features in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-manage-dark-features-in-jira-959286331.html])_&#xd;
&#xd;
This will cause WebHooks to be processed within the same request/Thread that triggered the event and *may increase response times* to end-users or API-clients.&#xd;
&#xd;
See [Best practices on working with WebHooks in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/best-practices-on-working-with-webhooks-in-jira-1180143465.html] on how to make best use of WebHooks in Jira.&#xd;
h4. B. Increasing queue size&#xd;
&#xd;
The Web-Hook-Events-Processor Thread pool and queue size can be adjusted with the following JVM startup parameters (example with their default values):&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
-Dwebhooks.executor.queue.size=200 -Dwebhooks.executor.thread.pool.size=10&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
_(ref.: [Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/setting-properties-and-options-on-startup-938847831.html])_&#xd;
&#xd;
A restart is required for the new params to work. In Jira Data Center it can be a rolling restart (one node at a time).&#xd;

Bug Summary:&#xd;
&#xd;
After upgrading Jira in environments using the collation '{*}en_US.utf8{*}', an error message is displayed and needs to be manually ignored on each node, if in a clustered environment.&#xd;

 # Start the Application&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected results&#xd;
&#xd;
The application is started up without any warning.&#xd;
h3. Actual results&#xd;
&#xd;
A warning is displayed that the collation is not supported:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Database: Your database is using an unsupported collation&#xd;

h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
This occurs because the health check verifies against all {{utf-8}} collations, and does not include {{{}utf8{}}}. {{utf8}} is a supported collation, we are incorrectly reporting this as a failure.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Follow the steps in [Configuring system properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-system-properties-168002854.html] and add in the following JVM flag for each node:&#xd;

??Developer for the health check here - I'm actively looking into this case. Just wanted to give an update: {{utf8}} is totally OK, the problem is we string match on {{utf-8}} which is why we're failing. If you're running {{utf8}} (say using the PostgreSQL docker image) you are supported, we're incorrectly reporting otherwise. Sorry about this! We're fixing it up.

&#xd;
After restoring Jira's XMl backup , some menus do not appear or a functionality is missing (example: missing Service Desk Request types). The missing data is caused by exceptions on restoring the data, where Jira ignores the rest of the data(responsible for the missing functionality) if it encounters problems with importing binary data.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
This issue is related to the the daylight saving time change. It affect only date custom fields "without time" of type "Date Picker" the Type "Date Time Picker" is not affected.&#xd;
All date entered after the daylight saving changes (Starting On March 25th and until Nov 30th) are affected. In this period the default time for the custom field will default to 11:00 PM ( one hour behind) instead of 12:00 ) > Jira is displaying the correct date in the UI, but when exporting to CSV the date will show up one day behind :&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
- The issue is reproducible in the following environment:&#xd;
 -- Jira 8.20.1&#xd;
 -- Java 11.0.11 and Java 11.0.14&#xd;
 -- Database: Oracle 19c&#xd;
 -- Jira system time is set to "Europe/London" and user profile Time zone is set to "London"&#xd;
- Steps&#xd;
 -- Create a custom date filed of type "Date Picker"&#xd;
 -- Create a record and choose a date between March 25 and November 30&#xd;
 -- View the record in Jira UI and notice the date&#xd;
 -- Export to CSV file, the date will be one day behind&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The export of the date field to CSV should reflect the same date as in Jira UI&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The export of the date field to CSV should not show up as one day behind&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Change the custom field date filed type from "Date Picker" to "Date Time Picker" following the steps in this KB:&#xd;
[How to change date custom field format from date without time to a date with time in Jira via the database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-change-date-custom-field-format-from-date-without-time-to-a-date-with-time-in-jira-via-the-database-1107628122.html]</description><createDate>2022-05-04T13:57:41.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>User are not searchable on assignee field when assigned to a shared group (assignee search dropdown does not return any result)</summary><key>JRASERVER-73406</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-73406</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
User are not searchable on assignee field when assigned to a shared group. The issue reproducible on Jira software versions >= 8.19.1.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create Group with name "Shared Group"&#xd;
# Add Some users to this group e.g. User1, User2&#xd;
# Create Check Boxes Custom field "Shared with" with value "Shared Group"&#xd;
# Add Assignable User Permission to Group Custom Field "Shared With" and remove other assignable user permissions if present.&#xd;
# Create issue with selected checkbox "Shared Group"&#xd;
# Edit issue and start typing username (User) in the assignee Field&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
User1, User2 are displayed in the suggestions and can be selected as assignee.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
User1, User2 are not displayed in the suggestions&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Set system Property -Dcom.atlassian.jira.use.optimised.user.lookup=false and restart the Jira instance.</description><createDate>2022-03-09T09:20:51.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is affecting my team on Jira 8.20.8.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a project key is renamed, the mail handler edit UI breaks after we click the first *Next* button - the edit screen vanishes.&#xd;
!image-2021-11-30-12-47-36-279.png|width=443,height=252!&#xd;
&#xd;
We can see in a HAR file that Jira sends to the UI the configured (old) project key and a list of the available project keys.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apparently, it doesn't check for old project keys, and when trying to match the one configured in the DB with the ones available, it breaks.&#xd;
&#xd;
Also, Jira doesn't check the mail handler configs to update them on a project key change.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a project&#xd;
 # Create a mail handler and associate with the project&#xd;
 # Change the project key&#xd;
 # Attempt to edit the mail handler&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It works normally.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The UI disappears after clicking the Next button.&#xd;
&#xd;
No errors are visible, as the error happens in the UI.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There are 2 possible solutions:&#xd;
 * Delete the mail handler and recreate it;&#xd;
(i) Tip: the {{SELECT}} query below gets the mail handler configurations. It might come in handy if/when recreating it.&#xd;
 * Or update the configs in the database directly:&#xd;
(!) Before starting, take a database backup and perform the procedure in staging first.&#xd;
 ** First identify the entry we need to update:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT *&#xd;
FROM propertystring&#xd;
WHERE &#xd;
id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE '%handler%')&#xd;
AND propertyvalue LIKE '%KEY%';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) Replace *KEY* in the {{WHERE}} clause for the old project key. If in doubt, remove the last line in the query to retrieve all mail handlers.&#xd;
 * Take note of the ID and copy the {{propertyvalue}} we wish to change.&#xd;
 * Update the desired entry:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
UPDATE propertystring&#xd;
SET propertyvalue = '&lt;edited_config>'&#xd;
WHERE id = &lt;id_from_query_above>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 * Restart Jira</description><createDate>2021-11-30T16:07:41.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Abruptly stopping node while project reindex is in progress causes inability to reindex Jira</summary><key>JRASERVER-72055</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-72055</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Abruptly stopping node while project reindex is in progress causes inability to reindex Jira. &#xd;
This problem is a more specific version of JRASERVER-47045&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Run a project reindex on node 1&#xd;
 # Abruptly terminate Jira process on node 1&#xd;
 # On node 2, go to Jira settings > System > Indexing page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Upon visiting Indexing page on node 2, reindexing operations are available.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Re-indexing operations are not available. The following message is displayed:&#xd;
{quote}The 'Lock Jira and rebuild index' option is unavailable while other indexing operations are in progress. See the Jira log for more details.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
!image-2021-02-03-13-22-49-743.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * If on Jira 8.5.4, 8.8.0 or higher, the stale task will get automatically removed within 30 minutes, that will self-resolve the problem (/) (see - JRASERVER-66204)&#xd;
 * Otherwise, restart the node that initiated the task, so the stale task gets cleared.&#xd;
 ** if it's hard to understand which node initiated the task, you can do a rolling restart.&#xd;
 * Sometimes the node that initiated the task itself could be removed and a new node could be built in place. It was noticed then that rolling restart did not fix it. Looking at the indexing page where the greyed out option is shown, the logs would point out something as below, where node-172.89.34.555 is the node that has been removed.&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
2024-06-04 17:30:05,938+0000 https-jsse-nio-8443-exec-61 url: /secure/admin/IndexAdmin.jspa, /secure/admin/jira/views/indexing.jsp; user: xxxxx INFO xxxx 1050x195x2 1e0pmmt 15.53.110.186 /secure/admin/IndexAdmin.jspa [c.a.j.w.a.admin.index.IndexAdminImpl] foreground re-index option is unavailable because of in-progress index task: TaskDescriptorImpl{taskId=229000, result=null, node=node-172.89.34.555, context=ProjectIndexTaskContext{projectId=39601, projectName='Danger', nodeId='node-172.89.34.555'}} {code}&#xd;
In that case utilize the scriptrunner script similar to [JRASERVER-66722|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66722] like below to kill the stale task and remove from the cache in each node, to open it up for re-indexing.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
import com.atlassian.jira.component.ComponentAccessor&#xd;
import com.atlassian.jira.task.TaskManagerImpl&#xd;
 &#xd;
def TaskManager = ComponentAccessor.getComponent(TaskManagerImpl)&#xd;
TaskManager.removeTask(xxxxxxx)&#xd;

So you stop one node that is doing reindexing, only to find other node start the same after previous is down and lock was freed, and you end up rolling entire cluster...

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
One or more mail servers use basic authentication warning displayed incorrectly&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Configure all incoming mail servers in *⚙ > System > Incoming Mail* to use the Oauth 2.0 authentication method&#xd;
 # Configure the outgoing mail server in *⚙ > System > Outgoing Mail* to use the basic authentication method&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The incoming mail server page displays a warning that says:&#xd;
{quote}One or more mail servers use basic authentication. This method is planned to be deprecated by Microsoft and Google. Update the authentication method to OAuth 2.0 for Jira to create issues based on received mail. Learn more&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
!Screenshot 2020-12-08 at 4.38.50 PM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The incoming mail server configuration page shouldn't show the warnings as all incoming mailboxes are using OAuth2 authentication.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Note about this bug&#xd;
&#xd;
The reason why this bug is occurring is because it incorrectly checks the authentication method of all mail servers configured in the Jira application (whether it's an incoming mail server or outgoing mail server), instead of only checking the incoming mail servers.&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
Batched notifications execute periodical tasks (every 14 days) to clean up old events from the {{AO_733371_EVENT}} and {{AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT}} tables. However, on unknown circumstances, this leads to extremely slow queries on the database if using Microsoft SQL Server. This issue seems to happen more often on older MSSQL versions such as 2012, 2014, 2016, but it was also reported with the version 2019.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue seems to be related to JRASERVER-65168 where it was described that single column indexes used by Jira might lead to this problem. Even though that specific bug is resolved, it wasn't created multi-column indexes for the batched notifications tables.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) The same problem can cause delays in batched notifications delivery.&#xd;
&#xd;
Example query:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
select "AO_733371_EVENT"."ID", "AO_733371_EVENT"."EVENT_TYPE", "AO_733371_EVENT"."USER_KEY", "AO_733371_EVENT"."ACTION", &#xd;
"AO_733371_EVENT"."ACTION_ID", "AO_733371_EVENT"."EVENT_BUNDLE_ID", "AO_733371_EVENT"."CREATED" &#xd;
from "jiraschema"."AO_733371_EVENT" "AO_733371_EVENT" &#xd;
&#xd;
where exists (&#xd;
	select "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT"."ID" &#xd;
	from "jiraschema"."AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT" "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT" &#xd;
	where "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT"."EVENT_ID" = "AO_733371_EVENT"."ID" and "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT"."STATUS" = 'NEW'&#xd;
	and "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT"."CONSUMER_NAME" = 'mailMentionEventConsumer'&#xd;
	and "AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT"."SEND_DATE" &lt;= '2020-04-29 06:14:41') &#xd;
and ("AO_733371_EVENT"."EVENT_TYPE" &#xd;
	in (92638,92593,92594,92594,92595,92596,92597,92599,92599,92600)) &#xd;
and "AO_733371_EVENT"."ID" >= 85125&#xd;
order by "AO_733371_EVENT"."ID" asc offset @P24 rows fetch next @P25 rows only&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h4. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up Batched Notifications (enabled by default on Jira 8.0)&#xd;
 # Have a large number of email notifications occurring daily&#xd;
 # Monitor the database CPU usage with graphs&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Expected Results&#xd;
 - The cleanup tasks occur without affecting the database performance, as it does on other DBMSs such as Postgres.&#xd;
 - The Jira Batched Notifications are sent in a timely manner (based on the frequency setting)&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Actual Results&#xd;
 - The cleanup tasks take several hours to complete, with the CPU spiking to 100% usage during that period. General slowness is experienced on Jira due to this.&#xd;
 - *The Jira Batched Notifications are sent with hours of delay*&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Note&#xd;

When analyzing thread dumps, we should see 2 Caesium threads running batched notification jobs:&#xd;

For everybody our there a quick summary: having this app, you can decrease the retention period how long events are kept in the AO_733371_EVENT. (default is 14 days) &#xd;
This leads to much less entries in the AO_733371_EVENT, which will hopefully have effects on performance.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Starting in Jira 8.6 there's a new Cluster monitoring page available to Jira system administrators gathers real-time data such as node ID, address, uptime (since the last restart), load and memory. The page displays the information for active nodes in your cluster, so whenever a node is down it disappears from the list. &#xd;
&#xd;
However, when there are two old Hipchat classes in the {{pluginstate}} table, the Clustering page does not work as expected. There are no errors reported in the backend, but in the frontend, you can see a Javascript error in the browser Developer tools:&#xd;
&#xd;
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Uncaught Error: acm/app/models/node-collection missing ajs&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install Jira Data Center 8.6.0 or higher &#xd;
 # Add the two classes below to your {{pluginstate}} table&#xd;
||pluginkey|pluginenabled||&#xd;
|com.atlassian.plugins.base-hipchat-integration-plugin| false|&#xd;
|com.atlassian.plugins.base-hipchat-integration-plugin-api|false|&#xd;
 # Restart Jira&#xd;
 # Try accessing the Clustering page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Clustering page works regardless of old Hipchat classes in the database.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Clustering page breaks when those classes are present, what is common on installations that are being upgraded from old Jira versions.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Delete the old classes with the SQL commands below and restart JIRA:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
delete from pluginstate where pluginkey = 'com.atlassian.plugins.base-hipchat-integration-plugin';&#xd;
delete from pluginstate where pluginkey = 'com.atlassian.plugins.base-hipchat-integration-plugin-api';&#xd;
delete from pluginstate where pluginkey = 'com.atlassian.labs.hipchat.hipchat-for-jira-plugin';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Jira automated backup might cause OutOfMemoryError (OOM) due to large dataset generated during export.&#xd;
&#xd;
{panel:title=Note| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}&#xd;
(!) For production use or large JIRA application installations, it is strongly recommended that you use native database-specific tools instead of the XML backup service. XML backups are not guaranteed to be consistent, as the database may be updated during the backup process. Inconsistent backups are created successfully without any warnings or error messages, but fail during the restore process. Database-native tools offer a much more consistent and reliable means of storing data.&#xd;

# Run Backup service and export data into xml.&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
System is stable&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Jira has memory pressure which causes poor performance or leads to *OutOfMemoryError*. &#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When they expire and users attempt to log in to Confluence or Jira they are not redirected to the Crowd Console.&#xd;
&#xd;
It also appears that users are not able to reset their expired passwords but have to use the "Forgot Password" link. &#xd;
&#xd;
A problem with this is some users do not have access to their email with crowd working since it uses Crowd for authentication.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce:&#xd;
# Have Jira configured to a Crowd user directory&#xd;
# Connect to crowd with admin privileges&#xd;
# Set the attribute {{requiresPasswordChange}} to {{true}} for a test user ( Example, usertest )&#xd;
# Synchronize Jira with Crowd&#xd;
# Connect to Jira as usertest&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
User should be able to change his password from Jira.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual results&#xd;
# Unable to login. The following message is displayed : "Sorry, your username and/or password are incorrect. Please try again"&#xd;
# usertest need to change their password from Crowd&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Ask you Crowd administrator to update the password at Crowd side.&#xd;
_OR_&#xd;
Set the attribute {{requiresPasswordChange}} to {{true}} and then ask the user to access the following Crowd URL to change the password:&#xd;
http://CROWD_URL/console/changeexpiredpassword.action&#xd;

&#xd;
I was trying to get users to change their passwords and used "requiresPasswordChange" = true. However, everytime I did this, no one was able to log on. No one is also able to change their password. The only way for any user in my company to change their password for all Atlassian products is for me to change it myself on Crowd. &#xd;
&#xd;
Feels pretty insecure to me if I'm the only who can change passwords, and I know everyone's password. Let alone they have to type it to me in some sort of insecure format like a chat program or email.</text><author>Henryk Tunguz-Zawislak</author></comments><comments><text>Any update on when this will be looked at?&#xd;
&#xd;
It's quite insecure all password change requests to have to go through me, and sticks our users in an uncomfortable spot where they're not the only one who knows their password. It's a glaring security hole and there's nothing at the moment I can do to prevent that. Compromised usage of my account could in turn, affect all our users.</text><author>Henryk Tunguz-Zawislak</author></comments><comments><text>[~henryk1] we do have another workaround to be applied on this case.&#xd;
You can set the flag at the Crowd side to force the password change and then ask your user to navigate to the following URL to change the password: http://CROWD_URL/console/changeexpiredpassword.action&#xd;
(i) Don't forget to replace the "CROWD_URL" above by your Crowd URL</text><author>Deyves</author></comments><comments><text>Hi @dsenger  (@&lt;you're name> doesn't seem to work...)&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Which flag exactly needs to be set? I'm not sure.&#xd;
&#xd;
I tried to set "requiresPasswordChange" to true and then direct my user to [https://crowd|https://crowd/].&lt;my organization>.com/crowd/console/changeexpiredpassword.action and [https://crowd|https://crowd/].&lt;my organization>.com/console/changeexpiredpassword.action but they got 404's and then a nullpointerexception.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Some random PDFs cannot be loaded in JIRA when accessing it via IIS proxy with ARR.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Windows OS with IIS proxy&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Setup an IIS proxy with ARR plugin in JIRA following [Integrating JIRA applications with IIS using ARR|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/integrating-jira-applications-with-iis-using-arr-313467089.html]&#xd;
# Access JIRA with proxy and upload PDF files&#xd;
# Click on the PDF file&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Behaviour&#xd;
PDF will be correctly displayed&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
It loads infinitely and throws 502 Bad Gateway Error&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Note &#xd;
The PDF is correctly displayed when bypassing the proxy&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workarounds&#xd;
* By [~jconroy]:  {quote}ARR proxy has a default chunk size of 256k.  It will download, cache and rechunk the file before it gets sent to the client. ARR also uses a response buffer with a 256k threshold.  In my analysis I've found ARR is not able to detect when the last chunk has been received (best guess is pdf-viewer is using a method not supported by ARR).  When ARR receives the httpresponse close, anything left in the response buffer is dropped and causes a 502.3 error.&#xd;
&#xd;
Resolution:&#xd;
&#xd;
Disabling Disk Cache on the proxy server will complete resolve the issue.  Additionally I recommend setting the response buffer threshold to 0 and setting the proxy keep-alive timeout from 30 to 180 seconds.  Although not required to fix this issue, the response buffer is know to cause issues with real-time bidirectional techniques such as SignalR, and the 30 second keep-alive can cause too frequent disconnects with other applications.{quote}&#xd;
* Increasing the keep-alive time seems to help in some cases.</description><createDate>2017-10-30T08:29:24.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We are experiencing the same issue. A fix or work-around (aside from telling the user to just click the download button) is very important to us. &#xd;
&#xd;
I would request the priority of this at least be adjusted upward. It's more than "Low" priority for us.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additional information from our experience:&#xd;
 * While the PDF viewer fails, the user can still use the download link.&#xd;
 * The error appears to not occur when the PDF is smaller than some threshold (possibly 64K?)&#xd;
 * Firefox seems to suffer from the problem far less often than other browsers (unconfirmed)&#xd;
 * Watching F12 developer tools, it appears the problem is somehow related to partial document requests (headers include a "range" value). Note the Content-Range header in the second screenshot provided by the OP. With smaller PDFs, these partial requests don't occur and everything seems to work correctly.</text><author>Aaron Craven</author></comments><comments><text>Hi,&#xd;

&#xd;
Summary:&#xd;
&#xd;
Both the jira-fileviewer-plugin and IIS ARR proxy utilize a chunked file transfer-encoding.  The is intended to improve performance by multi-threading the download of a single file by breaking into pieces and reassembling at the client.&#xd;
&#xd;
Aaron, you are correct with your guess of a  64k threshold, 64k is the default chunk size in the jira-fileviewer-plugin, smaller files will not get chunked.&#xd;
&#xd;
ARR proxy has a default chunk size of 256k.  It will download, cache and rechunk the file before it gets sent to the client. ARR also uses a response buffer with a 256k threshold.  In my analysis I've found ARR is not able to detect when the last chunk has been received (best guess is pdf-viewer is using a method not supported by ARR).  When ARR receives the httpresponse close, anything left in the response buffer is dropped and causes a 502.3 error.&#xd;
&#xd;
Resolution:&#xd;
&#xd;
Disabling Disk Cache on the proxy server will complete resolve the issue.  Additionally I recommend setting the response buffer threshold to 0 and setting the proxy keep-alive timeout from 30 to 180 seconds.  Although not required to fix this issue, the response buffer is know to cause issues with real-time bidirectional techniques such as SignalR, and the 30 second keep-alive can cause too frequent disconnects with other applications.&#xd;

Just an update to my last comment.  Please verify that you don't have a CORS issue first.  If you do, make user you have a fully qualified domain name in your URL rewrite rules.  Any cross origin scripting issues will need to be resolved before my above recommendation will help.&#xd;

&#xd;
I haven't done a deep dive into the pdf-viewer code so this may not be the issue, but make sure that it is properly sending a zero-length chunk to signal the end of the transmission. </text><author>James Conroy</author></comments><comments><text>James, thank you very much for your comment. We actually had disk caching disabled already, so that apparently did not apply to our situation. However, We located the buffer threshold and keep-alive settings and modified them as you recommended. In our case, keep-alive was set to 120, but we upped it to 180. I don't recall the buffer threshold setting, but it was non-zero (255, maybe?).&#xd;
&#xd;
After making those changes, our problem was (mostly) solved. Larger PDFs do seem to load properly in our test environments, and we hope to roll this out to our production environments soon.&#xd;
&#xd;
That said, we still notice that in most cases, these documents load slowly (sometimes painfully so). Watching developer tools in Chrome, I see some of the chunked requests take a lot longer than others to complete (20 seconds or so). I would attach a screenshot showing what I see, but I apparently cannot add attachments to this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
In any case, works-slowly is a huge improvement over doesn't-work-at-all, and I very much appreciate your help and suggestions. Thank you!</text><author>Aaron Craven</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>/status returns Maintenance instead of Running when nodes are not in Maintenance mode and the Database is configured with an unsupported collation</summary><key>JRASERVER-65708</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-65708</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. +Summary+&#xd;

&#xd;
Please check Jira does not contain any startup warnings. This can be done by accessing&#xd;
&lt;Jira BASE URL>/secure/errors.jsp&#xd;
&#xd;
Quite common case the issue occurs when Jira's database is using an unsupported collation. See an example below.&#xd;
&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2017-12-19 at 10.21.52.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
If that is the case, you can follow the instructions to fix that on your instance [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/health-check-database-collation-790955315.html]&#xd;
&#xd;
If you decide to utilize MySQL's {{utf8mb4_bin}} collation in Jira versions 7.6 or 7.13 the following automation script can be used to acknowledge the database collation warning:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
function clear_maintenance_mode_for_db_collation {&#xd;
    maint_check=$( curl -s localhost:7101/status | grep -c "MAINTENANCE" | cat )&#xd;
    if [  "${maint_check}" -gt 0 ]; then&#xd;
        collation_check=$( curl -s http://localhost:7101/secure/errors.jsp | grep -c "unsupported collation: utf8mb4_bin" | cat )&#xd;
        if [  "${collation_check}" -gt 0 ]; then&#xd;
            curl -u "${JIRA_CREDS}" http://localhost:7101/secure/johnson/events/dismiss&#xd;
            curl -u "${JIRA_CREDS}" http://localhost:7101/secure/johnson/warnings/acknowledge&#xd;
            sleep 5s&#xd;
        fi&#xd;

}&#xd;

Step to reproduce the issue: &#xd;
# Install Confluence and JIRA, create the application link by using OAuth with Impersonation.&#xd;
# Config the "Assigned to me" gadget on Confluence and create a page with the gadget. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected behavior &#xd;
When configuring the gadget, it should show the same as the gadget on JIRA without authentication request. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual behaviour&#xd;
When configuring the gadget, the "Login &amp; Approve" window popup which requires an authentication against JIRA before we can continue the configuration. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Business impact&#xd;
Since the trusted app is deprecated since Application link 5.2 and the actual Oauth system require one token per gadget per user, the user has to go through all gadget to generate the token to grant the access. This is having a huge user experience impact with the instance having 1k+ users as the feedback shared in the ticket https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-45189</description><createDate>2017-07-05T14:27:24.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>In certain circumstances, the Stop Watching functionality does not work correctly when unwatching issues reported by you while Autowatch is enabled.</summary><key>JRASERVER-65109</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-65109</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
As such it requires multiple watches and unwatches to get an issue unwatched; and can be very confusing. B&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Enable Autowatch reported issues (the default is set to Yes)&#xd;
# Create an issue, and remove yourself as the watcher.&#xd;
#* Note that the More menu item for watching is currently set to Watch Issue&#xd;
#* The sidebar Watchers field says Start watching this issue&#xd;
# Transition the issue, using a transition that has a screen and the comment field.&#xd;
&#xd;
Then, do one of the following:&#xd;
# Click Stop Watching this Issue&#xd;
# Click the number of watchers, then trash your own username&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
# The More menu item for watching is currently set to Stop watching&#xd;
# The sidebar Watchers field says Stop watching this issue&#xd;
# The lozenge for the watchers is grey (because you are not watching the issue)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
# The More menu item for watching is currently set to Watch issue&#xd;
# The sidebar Watchers field says Stop watching this issue&#xd;
# The lozenge is the same colour as if you were watching the issue still&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
* It looks like there are two seperate rest endpoints being used:&#xd;
** Used when removing self from the Watchers field via the lozenge: {{rest/api/2/issue/REP-2/watchers?username=&lt;username>}}&#xd;
** Used when removing self via the Stop Watching this issue link: {{rest/api/1.0/issues/10101/watchers}}&#xd;
&#xd;
Both requests return successfully (i.e, a 204 via the lozenge, and a 200 via the Stop watching this issue via the link). There was also some discussions about permissions being relevant, but it's tough to determine how relevant those permissions are.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) If you can reliably reproduce this behaviour where permissions for users are a factor, please reply in the comments section below.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, in some circumstances, the Watch Issue link is out life line with the rest of the menu, and doesn't behave like a menu item (but it can be clicked regardless).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround One:&#xd;
* Click Stop Watching this issue on the sidebar (alternatively, you can click More » Watch Issue&#xd;
* Click More » Watch issue&#xd;
* Click Stop Watching this issue - the issue should now unwatch correctly.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround Two:&#xd;
Using bulk tools, watch and then unwatch the issues (two seperate bulk issues). You can use {{key in watchedIssues()}} as a starting point to find all issues you're currently watching.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround Three:&#xd;
Disable Autowatch on own issues.

&#xd;
Perhaps the user interface needs to adhere to this mental model:&#xd;
&#xd;
WHEN I (a Jira user) click 'Stop watching' on a Jira issue,&#xd;
THEN I (a Jira user) stop receiving any e-mails and/or notifications about that issue. &#xd;
&#xd;
Which differs from the system designer's model of adhering to notification schemes (which are only editable by a system administrator).&#xd;

Anecdotally, I have experienced this issue in a couple of workplaces on many projects, and, in my experience, in response to this UX issue, users tend to:&#xd;
 * ignore/hide/disable all Jira notifications&#xd;
 * stop commenting on Jira tickets&#xd;
 * use other ways of communicating with the team that have the disadvantage of not being tied to a Jira issue number by default</text><author>Louie Christie</author></comments><comments><text>+1, Jira v7.12.1</text><author>Vitaly Alimirzoev</author></comments><comments><text>Found this on Jira v7.2.12</text><author>Deleted Account</author></comments><comments><text>Seeing this on 7.11.2</text><author>Alexander Garanin</author></comments><comments><text>Similar problem in 7.12.3.

Atlassian Support</text><author>Dave Norton</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Dave,&#xd;
&#xd;
We're an enterprise customer (10,000+ Users) and we're also seeing the same issue. &#xd;
The issue is occurring for us when a staff member moves a task from one service desk to another, then attempts to stop watching. &#xd;
&#xd;
The stop watching TEXT changes to "Start watching" but watch count doesn't drop.&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking refresh shows that no change has been applied. &#xd;
Clicking stop; start; stop does indeed work, but it's difficult to explain this to all our staff without sounding stupid - fundamentally they shouldn't need to employ workarounds like this.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is not limited to a particular component, and our permissions schemes are standard across both service desks.&#xd;

&#xd;
Thanks for the update - I can appreciate where you and your users are coming from. With regards to the permissions you mentioned that was more aimed at operating system level permissions (as there were some OS level elements of the un-cleaned-up bug report). Nevertheless, I appreciate you taking the time to add some additional light on the subject for us :)&#xd;

We are able to reproduce this problem by calling Java API WatcherManager.startWatching() on a postfunction, on some Jira versions (7.11, 7.13, 8.0).&#xd;

Regards.</text><author>Manuel Jesús Morión Barea</author></comments><comments><text>Further testing this behavior in our (Jira 7.13) environment. Not all issues are impacted. We have a project that uses a particular workflow. In that workflow, during an early transition, the "Reporter" is made a "Watcher".&#xd;
&#xd;
Tested an issue in that project/workflow that I was made a watcher of. In the test issue, I was the only watcher, but when I clicked Stop Watching This Issue, the number remained as 1 and I was still shown as a watcher. &#xd;
&#xd;
I did some additional experimentation on a different issue in this project/workflow and noticed that with someone else as the reporter and me as the employee name, we were both made watchers when the issue moved from Open to In Progress.  While it was In Progress, I selected View Watchers (the lozenge), clicked on the trash can icon next to the other user's name, and closed the Add Watchers popup.  This lozenged from 2 to 1, but the other user's name remained.  I then added a third user as a watcher and the lozenge changed back to 2, despite now 3 names being listed.  Clicking the trashcan next to my name changed the lozenge back to 1, but it remained blue (as if I were still a watcher).  Reloading the issue changed the lozenge to grey 2, with the other two users listed.  I deleted both of them and the lozenge went to grey 0 but reloading the page again restored their names and grey 2.  A few more clicks, deletions, and reloads and I was able to get the lozenge to grey 0 with myself listed as a Watcher.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, after adding and deleting the other two users and myself a few times, I was able to get the lozenge to report _*-1 watchers*_.  Clearly a bug.  And when I open the View Watchers, delete a user (again), the lozenge counts down again (I stopped at _*-10*_).</text><author>Chris Annal</author></comments><comments><text>Found this bug while being affected on 8.2.3 Data Center.&#xd;
While using bulk edit - unwatch issues, out of 145 issues, 59 were not processed.&#xd;
On one issue I manually went to the view page, hit stop watching / start watching / stop watching and that issue was unwatched properly.&#xd;
I'm still left with 58 affected issues.&#xd;
With a base of 600 active users, I don't know if any of my users are affected (most probably yes).&#xd;

h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Unable to proceed with Project Import due to errors on Custom Field Options. Example:&#xd;
{quote}The custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Have a source instance that has a Select List Custom Field (single choice) with one or more contexts and options&#xd;
 # Configure the same custom field in a target instance with the same contexts and custom field options&#xd;
 # Perform Project Import from source to target, using XML backup from source&#xd;
 # The import is blocked in certain cases&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Every project import will go fine&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In certain cases, it's not possible to proceed with the import. The below can be seen in the GUI under Custom Fields validation:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
The custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
One of the causes is when {{fieldconfiguration.id}} does not match {{fieldconfigscheme.id}}. By rights JIRA should use {{fieldconfiguration.id}} when looking up {{customfieldoption.customfieldconfig}}, but it incorrectly uses {{fieldconfigscheme.id}}, causing the problem. More details can be found in JRASERVER-65734.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
Attempting to JQL search for cascading select values results in an error like:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
An option provided by the function 'cascadeOption' for the field 'testcascadefield' does not exist.&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h4. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Have a cascading select field (i.e. testcascadefield) with at least 2 defined contexts. Let's call them ContextA and ContextBC&#xd;
 ** ContextA is configured for ProjectA&#xd;
 ** ContextB is configured for 2 projects: ProjectB and ProjectC&#xd;
 * Now configure the value options of ContextA and ContextB to have overlap&#xd;
 ** For example, let's say both allows for selecting the value "foobar"&#xd;
 * Ensure that your account *does not* have "Browse" permissions to ProjectB and ProjectC&#xd;
 ** This is the key trigger of the bug&#xd;
 * Now running the JQL:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
testcascadefield in cascadeOption("foobar")&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * We get the error:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
An option provided by the function 'cascadeOption' for the field 'testcascadefield' does not exist.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Now, if we grant the user account to either "Browse" permissions to either ProjectB or ProjectC, the error does not occur.&#xd;
&#xd;
So the problem occurs on 2 conditions:&#xd;
 # if there is a context containing no projects that the user account can see&#xd;
 ** As long as there's at least 1 project in the context viewable to the user, then the error does not occur.&#xd;
 # if there is a option in the context that is the same value as another context&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Expected Behaviour&#xd;
&#xd;
If an user does not have access to projects defined within a field's context, this should not affect the results for contexts that the user does have proper access to&#xd;
h4. Actual Behaviour&#xd;
&#xd;
No issues are returned and the user is instead presented with an error&#xd;
h4. Workaround&#xd;
 # Avoid using the function. "cascadeOption". So from the above example, use this instead:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
testcascadefield in ("foobar")&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Or check each context to ensure that the user has access to at least one of the projects listed&#xd;
 ## Note, you can create a blank project without any issues, assign it to a restricted context of your cascading field, give all users "browse project" permissions, and cascadeOption JQL condition will work as intended after that, since all users will have access to at least 1 project in the restrictive context.&#xd;
 # Or avoid having multiple contexts with the same option values&#xd;

*NOTE:* This suggestion is for {*}JIRA Server{*}. Using {*}JIRA Cloud{*}? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-60844].&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Problem Definition&#xd;
 * If a user customizes the session timeout as per [How to change the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+change+the+default+session+timeout], these changes are not reflected on the User Sessions page.&#xd;
 * The session is +not+ destroyed checking the atlassian-jira-security.log and the user does not get logged out, however on the User Sessions page, the session is removed after 4 hours.&#xd;
 * If the user is idle for more than 4 hours, the session disappears from the User Session page but does +not+ get logged out.&#xd;
 * If a user becomes active again after more than 4 hours, their session re-appears on the User Session page and will stay there until it has been idle for more than 4 hours again.&#xd;
 * The missing functionality is *not limited to a customized JIRA timeout, but also to standard JIRA session timeout*&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*(!)* *Note:* Initially this bug was thought to remove the actual user session from Tomcat and logging the user out, which multiple of the early comments are about. This was found to be separate bug with the Atlassian Bot Killer plugin which mistook regular sessions for bots and killed their sessions after 1 hour regardless of the session timeout value, https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70574. This bug was fixed in Jira 8.5.6.&#xd;
The Title has been updated to reflect this.&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Create 'test' user and log in as this user&#xd;
2. Open [http://JIRA_HOSTNAME/secure/admin/CurrentUsersList.jspa] as admin in another browser and you will see the 'test' user's session.&#xd;
3. Close the 'test' user session's window (to avoid AJAX requests)&#xd;
4. Set the system clock forward by 4h1m. &#xd;
5. Reload [http://[JIRA_HOSTNAME]/secure/admin/CurrentUsersList.jspa] and the 'test' user's session will not be listed.&#xd;
6. Open the 'test' user window again. Session is still active and you do not need to log in. &#xd;
7. Reload [http://[JIRA_HOSTNAME]/secure/admin/CurrentUsersList.jspa]and the 'test' user's session is back in the list.&#xd;
&#xd;
 </description><createDate>2016-05-02T15:45:00.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>My observation is there is a user inactivity timeout of around 50-60 minutes that will destroy a user's session regardless of the global session timeout value. In the current day of long lived 'desktop web apps' this is not a great result with reports of users on our local system losing information as they leave windows open and don't save immediately, etc.&#xd;
&#xd;
Looking at JIRA source code there is a hard coded max session age in "JiraUserSessionTrackerDeletionStrategy" that may be playing some role in this (although set at 4 hours):&#xd;
&#xd;
private static final long MAX_SESSION_AGE = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 4 hours&#xd;
&#xd;
In summary the default session timeout should work regardless of user inactivity to avoid this problem and make the web application appear more robust.&#xd;

&#xd;
I have set the session-timeout since years set 10 hours by setting a value of 600 minutes in web.xml (&lt;session-config>&lt;session-timeout>600...). In JIRA user sessions view there is no session displayed with more than 4 hours idle time. Such sessions will actually be destroyed.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, a user with between 4 and 10 hours idle time will directly get a new session without another login request. But this behavior was of course hard to find. And I also can not see how many users are actually using our JIRA per day (at least not from Web page).&#xd;

&#xd;
we had the same problem and triaged it to the Atlassian Bot Killer plugin. The plugin has a bug which makes it regard all users as bots and limits there session to one minute or one hour. The issue is explained in detail in the support request JSP-395805.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Analysis:&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira currently bundles the atlassian-bot-killer plugin. This plugin is supposed to detect bots/crawlers which only connect once to Jira and never again and reduce the inactive lifetime of their sessions stored in Jira.&#xd;
 Due to a bug in the plugin all users are considered bots and all sessions have their inactive lifetime reduced, overwriting all normally configured settings.&#xd;
&#xd;
(Analysis based on 1.7.5 of atlassian-bot-killer as bundled with Jira 7.2.3, first analysis indicates it also should affect 1.7.9 bundled with Jira 7.4.x)&#xd;
&#xd;
In BotKiller.java the method isThereAUserInPlay is used to determine if a request is performed by an actual user instead of anonymously.&#xd;
 For this it checks if the Jira usermanager is available to make sure this method will not fail during Jira startup or shutdown.&#xd;
 To hook into the Jira lifecycle the BotKiller class implements to LifecycleAwareInterface and expects to be managed by the Jira component system to call its onStart method to enable its real functionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
Unfortunately the class is not actually registered as a component in Jira (as indicated by the plugin manager web UI) and instead is managed by the BotKillerFilter class.&#xd;
 BotKillerFilter however does never call onStart, so that BotKiller never thinks that Jira has started and therefore classifies all requests as being from bots.&#xd;
&#xd;
It seems this new Lifecycle logic has been introduced between 1.7 and 1.7.5 of the plugin,&#xd;
 probably after reports like [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/JIRA-questions/Jira-Installation-problem/qaq-p/164115]&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Thomas Weißschuh</author></comments><comments><text>We were experiencing this issue and disabling the bot killer plugin does resolve the problem. Nice analysis Thomas.</text><author>Jonathan McCall</author></comments><comments><text>Just adding on here, this issue is still present in Jira 7.8.0 and the cause and fix appear to be the same. &#xd;
&#xd;
Jeff's testing methodology in this [Atlassian Community post|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/JIRA-session-timeout-set-to-1-hour-due-to-JIRA-bug-Okta-and-2FA/qaq-p/630382] remains valid, and I can confirm that disabling the atlassian-bot-killer system add-on causes the session to be created with the session timeout interval specified in web.xml rather than the 1 hour (3600 second) interval that Bot Killer was forcing on all sessions otherwise. &#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is particularly visible with SAML SSO setups like Okta's Jira On-Premise plugin, because users are forced to re-authenticate hourly and constantly deal with session timeout behavior (an already-open browser tab will stop responding to actions, and a refresh redirects to log-in) because they do not have the "Remember Me" cookie set. &#xd;
&#xd;
Hopefully Atlassian will ship a new version of the Bot Killer with properly implemented session length settings soon!</text><author>Taylor Barrett-Wilsdon</author></comments><comments><text>We are using since 2008-02 JIRA 7.6.2 and of course nothing has changed.

See [ACJIRA-513|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-513] description and comments for more details.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
There are a few alternative options workarounds; depending on the exact implementation you're using.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4.Option 1 - Remove the non-ascii characters&#xd;
If possible, change the non-ascii characters to ascii characters. This may not be desirable (or feasible) in all cases, however.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4.Option 2 - Encode the username and password as Base64 before sending&#xd;
Use the following command to generate a Base64 encoded string:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
echo -n 'username:password' | openssl base64&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Then, supply an {{Authorization: Basic token}} header, like so:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/jira/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-2 -H 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ='&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h4.Option 3 - Use Cookie authentication&#xd;
&#xd;
{panel:title=Information|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|titleColor=#FFFFFF|bgColor=#E7F4FA}&#xd;
(i) In some cases, we've seen a Base64 encoded string fail. In our testing, this _seems_ to be caused by an ASCII username, with a non-ascii character in the password. If you're seeing a Base 64 encoded string fail (and you're sure it's correct) then consider using the cookie method of authentication.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
You can use [cookie based authentication|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/cookie-based-authentication/] to authenticate first, and then use the cookie as your authentication mechanism in subsequent requests.</description><createDate>2016-02-16T12:08:34.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We seem to be facing the exact same issue, except in our case the international character is in the password instead of the username.</text><author>gitberg</author></comments><comments><text>Hi [~dyhrbergsystems]!&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks for adding that extra clarification. I'll update the bug report to include that information. As a workaround, can you generate a base 64 encoded version of the username and password, and then pass it as an authorization header?&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, to generate the base 64 encoded variable run the command&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
echo -n 'username:password' | openssl base64&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
This produces the output:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
... which can then be added as a header to a request. Using the example credentials from the bug report gives us {{QnVrYXN6OnRlc3Q=}}, which we can add as follows:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/jira/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-2 -H 'Authorization: Basic QnVrYXN6OnRlc3Q='&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Let me know if that workaround doesn't work for you, or if you have any other questions!&#xd;
&#xd;
Cheers,&#xd;

 </text><author>catworkx GmbH</author></comments><comments><text>Hi [~sebastian.gerdes@catworkx.de]! A base64 encoded string should work, but it from my testing (and the reports on https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-59460) it depends on where your non ascii characters are. If they're in the username, a Base64 encoded string should work (as I tested it when I updated this bug report). If they're in the password however, that'll still fail.&#xd;
&#xd;
I'll update the bug report so it's a little clearer that it might still fail even when encoded as Bas64.&#xd;
&#xd;
In such cases, your best bet would be to use the Cookie based method to obtain the cookie and then use _that_ to authenticate. While it's an extra step it should be a bit more robust.</text><author>Dave Norton</author></comments><comments><text>In my case, a Base64 encoded string doesn't work even if non-ascii characters are in the username.&#xd;

  {panel}

h3. Summary&#xd;
Permission schemes that have non-existent users explicitly added to a permission type cannot be edited (the header and sidebar load, but where the permissions should be listed is blank).&#xd;
&#xd;
There's two situations where this can occur:&#xd;
&#xd;
1) A user exists in a user directory, is granted explicit permission in a permission scheme, and the user directory that the user is in is subsequently disabled.&#xd;
&#xd;
2) Back in the days of JIRA Studio and Enterprise Hosted instances, there were two special users with the usernames "enterprise-hosted-support" or "contegix" (or both) that were the equivalent of the current "sysadmin" user. There's several places in JIRA's codebase that check for this username and exclude it from various operations.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
# Start a local JIRA, connect it to an external user directory of some sort.&#xd;
# Add a user that exists only in that directory (and not the internal JIRA directory) to a permission scheme.&#xd;
# Import that JIRA data into a Cloud instance.&#xd;
# Try to edit the permission scheme.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected results&#xd;
The permission scheme page loads.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual results&#xd;
Where the permissions _should_ be is blank, and this stack trace is thrown in the logs:&#xd;

h3. Workarounds&#xd;
h4. Workaround 1&#xd;
For Cloud specifically, the following SQL will find the individual user and which permission scheme they're part of:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT  distinct(p.name),&#xd;
        s.perm_type,&#xd;
        s.perm_parameter&#xd;
FROM    permissionscheme p,&#xd;
        schemepermissions s&#xd;
WHERE   p.id = s.scheme AND&#xd;
        s.perm_parameter NOT IN (&#xd;
            SELECT  user_name&#xd;
            FROM    cwd_user&#xd;
            WHERE   directory_id = (&#xd;
                SELECT  id&#xd;
                FROM    cwd_directory&#xd;
                WHERE   directory_name = 'Remote Crowd Directory'&#xd;
            )&#xd;
        ) AND&#xd;
        s.perm_type = 'user'&#xd;
ORDER BY p.name asc;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
To remove all of the missing users from the permission schemes:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
DELETE FROM schemepermissions&#xd;
WHERE perm_type = 'user' AND&#xd;
perm_parameter NOT IN (&#xd;
    SELECT  user_name&#xd;
    FROM    cwd_user&#xd;
    WHERE   directory_id = (&#xd;
        SELECT  id&#xd;

This seems to impact any url encoded characters such as %2F in my case.  Your customers will have a lot of problems trying to hook into Azure's Logic apps.</text><author>Sam Bosell</author></comments><comments><text>This also happens in the link editor in Confluence: if you insert a link to a web site on a page by using the insert link button, saving the link will replace all characters not allowed in a URL (spaces, %-characters etc.) with the url code for that character (%20 for space, %25 for % etc.). For most characters this is nice behavior, but it also replaces the % characters that are part of an already encoded character.&#xd;
&#xd;
Since the url encoding contains a % character as well, these encodings will also be replaced. So if you save a link to url "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1 password", it will be changed to "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1%20password". If you open the link editor for the same link (don't change the URL) and save, the URL will be transformed to "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1%2520password". so the % sign is replaced by %25, changing %20 into %2520. One can repeat the process, adding 25 after the % sign at every attempt (%252520, ...).&#xd;

&#xd;
_"There isn't any workaround for this on JIRA side. However, I'm not too sure if it's possible but the following may be worth a shot: you could try setting up a proxy server to catch requests to any URL containing *%25* and redirect it to the regular URL instead. We won't be able to assist with configuring the proxy though as it is not something we are familiar with. Alternatively, you could try contacting one of our [Atlassian Partners|https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/11828703/www.atlassian.com?p=eyJzIjoiTTk4cktGSERaVzBiZDhBeWhOMkVxRXZWb3dZIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjoxMTgyODcwMyxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5hdGxhc3NpYW4uY29tXFxcL3BhcnRuZXJzXCIsXCJpZFwiOlwiNjVhY2U3YzcyZWM3NGEzNjg4MGM3MGNkOGQzMTA2MDdcIixcInVybF9pZHNcIjpbXCI5MWIwZmVmYzE0MGYwMTQ1MDBhZGQ1NWI3ZDA5OGE1NTlhZWY3ODE3XCJdfSJ9] for paid services to develop/customize a workaround for you."_&#xd;

&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
SELECT [ID]SELECT [ID]      ,[pkey]      ,[issuenum]      ,[PROJECT]      ,[issuetype]      ,[SUMMARY]      ,[issuestatus]      ,[UPDATED]      ,[RESOLUTIONDATE]   , RESOLUTION  FROM [Jira].[jiraschema].[jiraissue] --where issuetype = 10004  where (issuestatus = 6 or issuestatus = 10200)  --closed and promoted and ( resolution is NULL or resolutiondate is NULL)  order by id; &#xd;
&#xd;
To update the fields, I use the following manual update  (after which I perform a Re-Index on the entire Jira instance - which seems to fix things.)&#xd;
  update [Jira].[jiraschema].[jiraissue]  set RESOLUTIONDATE = UPDATED , resolution = 10000  where (issuestatus = 6 or issuestatus = 10200) --closed and promoted and ( resolution is NULL or resolutiondate is NULL);&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
We are toying with using another API call to perform an Index action on the issue (which is what happens when an issue is resolved via the UI.)   &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When editing an issue that doesn't have a priority indicated, the selected priority in the list is not the default priority from the priority scheme.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Set the default priority to critical&#xd;
# Create a new project &#xd;
# Configure the field configuration to hide the "Priority" field&#xd;
# Create a ticket which uses the modified field configuration&#xd;
# Re-add the priority field to the field configuration (Show)&#xd;

# Look for the priority field&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The selected priority in the list is the default priority from the priority scheme.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The selected priority in the list is *not* the default priority from the priority scheme, instead it is simply the first option in the list.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
This is actually happening because hiding the Priority field from the field configuration will cause issues to be created without a value in "Priority". When an issue that does not have a priority is edited, the priority selected by default on the list will always be the top option.&#xd;

Atlassian, could you please confirm whether this is actually a bug or a matter of works as designed?</text><author>Nadine Schütt</author></comments><comments><text>Hello [~nadine.schuett1]! We have analyzed this report, and found that the real bug is that the Priority field is not being filled when the field is hidden. Normally the Edit screen would show the priority that the issue has already saved but as it would be empty for this scenario the default behavior is to show the first on the list. As a bit of housekeeping we have reshaped the format of the Issue summary as well as added additional information like the affected version you have shared with us and the latest Jira 7.12.3, where we were able to replicate and find the underlying cause. As for a fix for this request, I'm afraid that there has not been enough interest for this to gain traction for now, but we will keep this request open to gather feedback.&#xd;

&#xd;
As per this document [Embed your plan using an iFrame|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/embed-your-advanced-roadmap-plan-on-a-non-confluence-page/], it is possible to share a Jira plan timeline view using an iframe and embed it on any site as long as the permissions are correct for the person loading the view (is logged in with an Atlassian account that has the correct permissions)&#xd;
&#xd;
Still, since the response has the *x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN* header, the content doesn't load in external sites that are not the same Cloud instance.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) With [New Transition Experience|https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-articles/Now-GA-try-the-new-issue-transition-experience-in-Jira/ba-p/2734436] enabled, when "Select List (multiple choices)" field type is made required using "Field Required Validator", error is thrown during transitions, even when values are present. In other words, for "Select List (multiple choices)" field type "Field Required Validator" requires field to be updated during the transition, not only to be populated.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue does not occur with other field types or when the [New Transition Experience|https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-articles/Now-GA-try-the-new-issue-transition-experience-in-Jira/ba-p/2734436] is disabled.&#xd;
&#xd;
(on) Also, in the "Validators" tab of the workflow transition editor, "Field Required Validator" has the following information:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
If a value for field Select List (multiple choices) is not provided during the transition, show the following error: This field is required. {code}&#xd;
which is not how the "Field Required Validator" works and/or worked with the Old Transition Experience.&#xd;
&#xd;
There are 2 distinct validators available:&#xd;
||Name||Description||&#xd;
|Field Required Validator|Field must not be empty during the transition.|&#xd;
|Field has been modified Validator|Field value must be changed during the transition.|&#xd;
&#xd;
Therefore the above text should be more clear.&#xd;

 # Fill out the field before attempting the transition.&#xd;
 # Attempt to transition an issue with values already set in the "Select List (multiple choices)" list fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The transition should proceed without errors if all fields specified in "Field Required Validator", have values.&#xd;

I have created this ticket to track the confusion caused by this issue. *It is impossible to use basic search to filter numbered priorities.*&#xd;
h3. Steps to replicate:&#xd;
 # Modify the default priorities to match the below:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
 id | sequence |  pname  &#xd;
----+----------+---------&#xd;
 1  |        1 | Blocker&#xd;

 # Use the Jira basic issue search to create a filter to select the priorities with name "1". &#xd;
 # Save the filter&#xd;
 # Reopen the filter and observe the priority selection is updated to the wrong one.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Behavior:&#xd;
&#xd;
JIRA will return any issues with priority = blocker as the filter was saved as "priority = 1" which hits: JRACLOUD-82131&#xd;
h3. Expected Behavior:&#xd;
&#xd;
JIRA would see that "1" (with quotes) is a priority name and would only return results by the name. The underlying JQL should be stored in a compatible format.&#xd;
h3. Workaround:&#xd;
 * Use JQL to search:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Users experience an issue where column presets for a saved filter change unexpectedly when refreshing the filter page. The columns switch to "My Defaults" rather than retaining the specific filter's column settings. This behavior occurs upon refreshing the page and sometimes when clicking the back button to navigate back to a filter view, despite the URL indicating the user is still on the specific filter view.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open a saved filter in Jira and observe the columns configured for that filter.&#xd;
 # Without making any changes, simply refresh the page.&#xd;
 # Observe that the displayed columns are now showing the "My Defaults"&#xd;
 # Click on the table settings and notice that it is also selected to the "My Defaults" tab.&#xd;
 # Click on the "Filter" tab within the settings and notice that the correct columns/fields are now displayed&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filter page should retain the column settings specific to the saved filter when navigating back or refreshing the page.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The filter page displays columns set in "My Defaults" instead of the specific filter's columns. The table column settings default to "My Defaults," requiring manual re-selection of the "Filter" tab to restore the correct columns.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Manually open the table column settings and switch from "My Defaults" to the "Filter" tab to restore the correct column view.</description><createDate>2025-03-31T18:15:50.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We have investigated the issue regarding the "Filter columns reverting to MyDefaults" when refreshing the filter page. Our tests indicate that this behavior is functioning as intended.&#xd;
&#xd;
The change in column configuration which got reported occurs due to an updated filter, which is expected behaviour. Specifically, the filter column configuration will reset to "MyDefaults" if the filter is modified. For example, this can happen if you select a filter, choose an assignee from the dropdown, and then refresh the page. You can confirm this by looking for a go back to filter button or a save filter button in the New Issue Navigator:&#xd;

This issue happens if you're using the *New issue transition experience* as described [here|https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-articles/Now-GA-try-the-new-issue-transition-experience-in-Jira/ba-p/2734436#M14880].&#xd;
&#xd;
The value is cleared even if the Workflow does not have defined any Post Function to clear the value.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}NOTE{*}: If you have the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field's Field configuration set as *Required* you'll see an error in the Transition screen stating that the {color:#ff0000}_Field is required,_ even if you'll notice that the value is filled out.{color})&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Select List (Multiple choices) custom field.&#xd;
 # Make sure that the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field created in step 1 is added to a Transition screen within your Workflow.&#xd;
 # Make sure to add the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field created in step 1 as a Required field in any Request Form.&#xd;
 # Create a work item from the Customer Portal using the Request Form defined in step 3 and make sure to select one of the options available of the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field.&#xd;
 # After the work item is created make sure that the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field is filled out with the value selected in Step 4.&#xd;
 # Try to transition the work item to the status related to the Transition screen defined in Step 2.&#xd;
 # Notice that the value of the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field is cleared out from the value selected in 4.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
You are able to transition the issue and the value of the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field is not cleared out. The same value selected during the issue creation from the Request Form should still be there.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If you have the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field's Field configuration set as *Optional* you'll notice that even though the value was initially filled out the value of the custom field changes to *None* and is cleared out.&#xd;
&#xd;
{*}NOTE{*}: If you have the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field's Field configuration set as *Required* you'll see an error in the Transition screen stating that the _Field is required,_ even if you'll notice that the value is filled out.)&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Remove the Select List (Multiple choices) custom field from the transition screen if you're using the *New issue transition experience* as described [here|https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-articles/Now-GA-try-the-new-issue-transition-experience-in-Jira/ba-p/2734436#M14880].&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira, when a status is initially added to a workflow, the transition leading into that status is named the same as the status itself.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, if the status is renamed later, the transition name does not change. This unchanged transition name appears in various locations, such as the transition dropdown on the main issue view, the transition screen header, and in bulk operations under the "Available Workflow Actions" column.&#xd;
&#xd;
This situation can confuse end users as processes evolve with workflows, requiring terminology alignment. Additionally, it increases administrative overhead due to discrepancies in naming conventions, necessitating manual cleanup tasks.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce:&#xd;
&#xd;
Example steps to reproduce behavior:&#xd;
 * Add a status named "test" to a workflow&#xd;
 * select "all statuses can transition to this issue"&#xd;
 * Rename the status to "Renamed Status"&#xd;
 * Publish the workflow&#xd;
 * Do a Bulk transition operation or select the transition dropdown of an issue associated to the workflow&#xd;
 * Observe that there is an option for "test" > "Renamed Status" is present causing confusion&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. NOTES and Suggestion:&#xd;
&#xd;
The intention of this functionality is that the transition names can be customized, and renaming a status should not impact the workflow if customized, but it would be beneficial to have an option for a warning message popup when renaming a status to ask if the admin also wants to update the transition name to align with the status update on associated workflows.&#xd;
h3. This will have done two valuable things:&#xd;
 # Immediately informed the admin making the status change that there is a difference between the two and that difference matters for aligning workflow terminology&#xd;
2. Will allow an Admin to change the setting with a single step in that resulting modal pop-up which Saves on manual cleanup intervention and administrative overhead once the discrepancy is discovered</description><createDate>2025-03-28T21:41:22.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Log in as user function incorrectly assigns the ticket when using the Assign to me button</summary><key>JRACLOUD-93856</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-93856</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

1. Create a custom field (e.g., {*}"testCustomField"{*}) and add it to a screen.&#xd;
2. Populate some issues with values while leaving others empty.&#xd;
3. Run JQL: testCustomField IS EMPTY → Returns correct results (empty fields).&#xd;
4. Delete the custom field and recreate it with the same name.&#xd;
5. Populate some issues with values while leaving others empty.&#xd;
6. Run JQL: testCustomField IS EMPTY → Incorrect results (issues with values appear).&#xd;
7. Run JQL using the field ID: cf[ID] IS EMPTY → Returns correct results.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) *Workaround* However, if we search the JQL with customfield_id like {color:#ff0000}cf[12345] ~ EMPTY {color}then it will work as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i)  Also with the new custom field with same field, it is able to search the text as expected. But the issue is with (is EMPTY) it is not taking effect.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Change from "issue" to "work item" has caused unintended replacement of the word "issues" when not referring to Jira Issues. This seems to have been done in bulk to replace the usage of the word "Issues" when referring to items within Jira to "Work Items", but was not double checked for context. As a result, places in Jira that used the term "issues" in a different context appears to have replaced that word with "work items", even though on context it is not referring to a jira issue. One example can be found when creating a For: JQL branch in automation, where disabling the option "Only include work items that have changed since the last time this rule executed" results in a warning that reads "May cause performance work items", instead of "May cause performance issues"&#xd;
&#xd;

Also cases where changes have not occurred but where documentation seems to have been updated as though it has. In this case, the entire Issue settings menu at /jira/settings/issues/issue-types (consistent for all of the pages under /issues it seems and for the drop down settings menu)&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira Boards and Backlog pages might load slowly for a few users on large sites. We have observed the slowness in loading on the Backlog pages due to permission checking, particularly affecting users with extensive project permissions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The slowness is observed even with Boards is JQL with the {{Project}} conditions.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Example/context:* user *X* has permission to almost all the groups, and roles, everywhere in Jira, and this is slowing down the {*}permission search functionality{*}, On the other hand, a user *Y* that has less permission, the *permission search functionality* will be less stressed and take less time&#xd;
&#xd;
Note: The development team is already working on it&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # It can be reproduced only by selected users with extensive permissions in many projects&#xd;
 # A Jira administrator can replicate it by [impersonating|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/log-in-as-another-user/] the user affected &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Board with JQL should load faster (less than 5 seconds)&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Backlog &amp; Board pages will load slower for few users. The backlog page takes a long time to load ~10 seconds&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An inaccurate textual description "Custom Jira logo" is specified for the "CG Logo" image link.&#xd;
h3. Note:&#xd;
&#xd;
To resolve the current bug, it is necessary to implement a feature that enables administrators to add alt text for the custom logo. This functionality should be flexible enough to allow admins to customize the alt text according to their organization's specific requirements.&#xd;
&#xd;
Feature Request Link: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-93781]&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the Jira Cloud instance with custom logo present.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the mentioned image link in the header section.&#xd;
 # Listen that the textual description is not describing the functionality of the image link.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Inaccurate Alt Text.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate through the header section in Jira, the "CG Logo" informative image link is announced as "Custom Jira logo", which does not accurately convey the information visually represented by the image.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue occurs because inaccurate alt text has been provided in the "alt" attribute.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, this creates a poor experience for screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the accurate textual description of the image is read out by the screen reader.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes:&#xd;
 * Provide an appropriate and accurate textual description for the informative image.&#xd;
 * Ensure that the textual description accurately reflects the purpose of the image.&#xd;
 * In this case, ensure that the textual description for the mentioned image link is "CG Jira Homepage".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Code Snippet:&#xd;
&#xd;
*Syntax:* &lt;img src="..." alt="ClientName_ ProductName_Homepage">&#xd;

This is reproducible on Data Center: (no)&#xd;
Anonymously accessible REST endpoints allow invalid user credentials to be used.&#xd;

This is incorrect. The user can't add any option id in the condition editor. Users can only select the options by name in the custom field.

When editing a *code block* of JSON or any other code, the editor in Jira issue’s Comments or description or multi-line text field, provides automatic formatting which breaks the structure of the JSON or any other code block. To understand the issue please check the following video:&#xd;
The issue is only replicable in {*}Firefox v136.0.2 or v136.0.1 running on MacOS{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, in the editor, when typing :&#xd;

\n&#xd;
&#xd;
Type here something then give another newline in the next line&#xd;
&#xd;

One example to replicate this is to create 2 release versions and add those 2 at the same time in the issue which will create one history item with 2 fix version field change. This will end up throwing "Duplicate key Fix Version"&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
Documentation Snippet :- &#xd;
Text fields&#xd;
Similar to text, this is a master-field that allows you to search in most text fields (except Comments, Worklog) for work items, such as:&#xd;
- Summary&#xd;
- Description&#xd;
- Environment&#xd;
- custom fields that use the "free text searcher"; this includes custom fields of the following built-in custom field types:&#xd;
   - Free text field (unlimited text)&#xd;
   - Text field (&lt; 255 characters)&#xd;
   - Read-only text field&#xd;
The textfields master-field can only be used with the CONTAINS operator ("~").&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
 &#xd;
*Issue Summary:* *&#xd;
 * When searching the field directly as Free Text searcher which is using textfields ~ "&lt;value>" in JQL, the field is not included in results (which contradicts the [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/jql-fields/#Text-fields]).&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
User is unable to transition issues when using a  3rd party apps workflow conditions or validators for multi-line text fields.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install a 3rd party app (e.g. script runner) for the instance&#xd;
 # Create a custom multi-line text custom field&#xd;
 # Add a Validator or Condition from this app for this field using Jira expression on a transition&#xd;
e.g issue.customfield_&lt;ID>.replace('\n','Text')&#xd;
 # Perform a transition via the new issue transition experience&#xd;
 # Try on the old issue transition - we can create an issue&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Root cause:&#xd;
&#xd;
The new transition experience utilises the ADF (Atlassian Document Format), while various APIs rely on older approaches that depend on Wiki Markup for multi-line text fields. Customers may have crafted Jira Expressions based on Wiki Markup for these conditions and validators, which cannot parse text from ADF representations due to these format changes. Consequently, validators and conditions fail, causing transitions to be unavailable or validations to return incorrect results. This results in the Jira Expression framework used by ScriptRunner and other apps not functioning as intended.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue can be transitioned.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We can not perform the transition.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use Single line text field instead OR make modifications to their workflow validators set up on multi-line text fields. &#xd;
&#xd;
These modifications should ideally cater for fields being in either a wiki format or a ADF format when being processed.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, the following snippet will supply a function called plainText that can be used to transform either ADF or RichText fields into plainText. &#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
let plainTextValue = value => typeof value == 'Map' ? new RichText(value).plainText : typeof value == 'RichText' ? value.plainText : value ;&#xd;
plainTextValue(issue.customfield_10000) == "Some text" || plainTextValue(issue.description) == "Some text"&#xd;
{code}&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Create the custom field named _Release_ _Notes_ as Multiline text field with _Default Text Renderer_ configured.&#xd;
 * Add this field to a company-managed project screen.&#xd;

&#xd;
The pop-up window shouldn't strike through text that has hyphens at the start and end. Which renderer is used in the popup should depend on the custom field configuration, like default text or wiki-style. The renderer should match the custom field so that reserved formatting characters only work if the Wiki-style renderer is used.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When changing the workflow status, users experience an issue where scrolling down to select a status causes the selection to quickly jump back to the top of the status list. This requires users to scroll down again or close the window and attempt the status selection once more.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Open an issue which has large number of status and requires scrolling down&#xd;
# Navigate to the status to bottom of the list&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
# User should be able to see the status in the bottom of the list&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The list refreshes quickly to jump back to the top of the status list&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Have a multi-line text field on the "hide when empty" section of the Issue layout configuration&#xd;
 # Create a new ticket with no value to the multi-line text field&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The sub-task description is intermittently replaced with the parent issue's description when an action item (checkbox) is clicked&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a parent issue in Jira or Jira Service Management. Set the Description to some text, or some bullets, but don’t include any action items.&#xd;
 # Create a couple of sub-tasks. Add 3 or 4 action items to the Description of each sub-task. Leave all of them unchecked.&#xd;
 # {_}Without going into edit mode{_}, click the first or the second action item within a sub-task’s Description.&#xd;
&#xd;
Step 3 above usually triggers the over-writing of the description with the parent’s description.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Expected results would be for the action item check boxes to simply become checked with no change to the field value. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;

On the slack page, the “Issue title” link and "More options" button does not have an appropriate reading order.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install and open the Jira cloud app or Slack.&#xd;
 # Open the app and connect to a server and project.&#xd;
 # Read through the results with a screen reader.&#xd;
 # Observe that the reading order is not followed as per the logical order.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Inaccurate reading order.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The More Options menu to the right of an issue title is read first, then the title of the issue is read. This makes it confusing for a screen reader user to determine the relationship between the more options menu and the issue it acts upon, especially when reading through a large list of issues. Additionally, the tab order is reading the content from right to left and this inappropriate reading order might disorient the users of screen readers. That the content is available at the end might confuse or mislead them.&#xd;
&#xd;
For instance, screen reader read the content in the following order of the page:&#xd;
 # "More options" button&#xd;
 # “Issue title” link&#xd;
&#xd;
This inaccurate reading order will create confusion for screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen reader should read the content in the correct logical order for its users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Place the content of webpages in correct meaningful sequence in the source code. Move the content in the page source in the below mentioned order. CSS can be used to maintain the presentation of the page. Assistive technologies navigate content using the order in which elements appear in the DOM. Hence, make sure that the content is programmatically ordered in such a way that it provides an appropriate reading order to the users of assistive technologies.&#xd;
&#xd;
Correct Reading order should be:&#xd;
 # “Issue title” link&#xd;
 # "More options" button&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. *Code Snippet:*&#xd;
&#xd;
*&lt;a target="_blank" .... Tooltip inaccessible for screen reader and…*&#xd;

If you populate a paragraph custom field (default renderer) with line breaks in a transition screen, the next time you open the transition screen those line breaks will be lost.&#xd;
&#xd;
See the recording:  [^Line break in transition screen.mp4] &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
* Add a paragraph custom field to a transition screen&#xd;
* Make sure the [field's renderer|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-renderers/] is *Default Text Renderer*&#xd;
* Trigger the transition where that transition screen is&#xd;
* Populate the paragraph custom field adding some line breaks (*Enter*)&#xd;
* Conclude the transition&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Making a JQL query filter using the filter field that uses a negation returns incorrect search results.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Be on the new search experience as mentioned in this [document|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-the-new-jira-issue-search-experience/]&#xd;
 # Create a filter that uses the negation term. For example&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
filter != SprintName&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The result should be populated based on the search criteria&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The results omit certain search results. For example, if the results should be a 20 issue count, the result becomes a 3 issue count which is incorrect. This is because when optimising a negation filter, *EMPTY* is wrongly added to *NOT IN ()*&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Switch to the old issue search experience to return correct search results.</description><createDate>2025-02-25T13:54:34.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We are seeing a different inconsistency between old and new Issue Search that has nothing to do with the *!=* or *NOT IN()* operators:&#xd;
&#xd;
Specifically it is around the use of *issue* vs *issuekey* fields maybe in conjunction with the *OR* operator.&#xd;
&#xd;
This query:&#xd;
&#xd;
{{*issue* in (portfolioChildIssuesOf("RSGSDK-63"), portfolioChildIssuesOf("RSGSDK-97"), portfolioChildIssuesOf("RSGSDK-98"), portfolioChildIssuesOf("RSGSDK-99")) OR *issue* in (RSGSDK-63, RSGSDK-97, RSGSDK-98, RSGSDK-99)}}&#xd;
&#xd;
Returns *26 issues* in New Issue Search, and *45 issues* in Old Issue Search.&#xd;
&#xd;
If I change ONLY the first or second *issue* in the query to {*}issuekey{*}, I then get 45 issues in both Old and New Search. If I change both to {*}issuekey{*}, I again get only 26 issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is INFURIATING. JQL results should be consistent regardless of the UI.&#xd;

I mean, COME ON.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apparently there were other issues with text searches when the new search engine (JSIS) launched. Was this back in July?&#xd;
 * JRACLOUD-84063 Rollout of the new search engine (JSIS) is causing some dashboard gadgets to not reflect correct data&#xd;
&#xd;
Looks like [~528dfc25228c] and team eventually fixed this (after just turning off new the new search engine for some tenants), but uh, I think there's still some incorrectness out there.&#xd;
&#xd;
It's disappointing that this change was apparently NOT announced anywhere. I get it - you're replacing the search engine and hoping that it's 100% compatible. But clearly it wasn't/still isn't:&#xd;

*45 results*&#xd;
&#xd;
So BTW I did take a closer look at the 45 results. The 19 "missing" issues are in a different project than RSGSDK. So it seems that the new JQL engine doesn't anticipate that a Child can be in a different Project. (Even though those issues display the parent/child relationship just fine.)&#xd;
&#xd;
But I mean hey, maybe it's an issue with the {*}OR{*}, maybe it's a problem with getting rid of *Epic/Parent* fields, maybe it's the phase of the moon. I'm just saying that this, as well as the other tickets I linked to do seem to indicate a lack of thoroughness in testing this new JQL engine. Which... is bad. &#xd;
&#xd;
Because especially as # of issues grows, it's very hard to find discrepancies like this. I shudder to think about customers out there with large swaths of bugs going unreported/unaddressed because of this failure.</text><author>Darryl Lee</author></comments><comments><text>We found another case where we were getting incorrect results:&#xd;
{{textfields ~ "MDS-744" or textfields ~ "MDS_744"}}&#xd;
&#xd;
It finds nothing, but if we search for just the first bit *textfields ~ "MDS-744"* then it finds issues.  How can an OR cause it to find fewer results?&#xd;
&#xd;
</text><author>Darryl Lee</author></comments><comments><text>I recommend that if you are seeing inconsistent results like this - open ticket with Support and ask them if they can revert you to the old search engine (JVIS) until they fix this.&#xd;

BTW, some definitions:&#xd;
 * JVIS (Jira Vertigo Issue Search) - old search engine&#xd;
 * GIN (Global Issue Navigator) - old issue search UI &#xd;
 * JSIS (Jira Scalable Issue Search) - new search engine that backs (but apparently is not a dependency for) AI-powered issue search UI, known as...&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Users experience a 429 error (Rate-Limiting) when editing issues in the Issue Modal View on TMP Software boards with a large number of issues. This seems to occur due to a spike in API calls made by the system, leading to rate limiting.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Access a TMP software board with a high number of issues, including Sub-tasks (e.g., 600+ issues).&#xd;
 # Add a custom field to the tasks/events on the board (e.g., a single-select field).&#xd;
 # Open an issue on the board using the Issue Modal View.&#xd;
 # Edit the custom field multiple times (approximately 10-20 times).&#xd;
 # Observe the occurrence of a 429 error.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Editing issues via the Issue Modal View should not result in a 429 error, regardless of the number of issues on the board.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Editing issues in the Issue Modal View on boards with a large number of issues leads to a 429 error, as the system makes excessive API calls.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
To avoid the 429 error, users can open and edit issues using the Full Issue View in a separate window or tab, rather than making edits directly in the Issue Dialog Modal through the Board view. This prevents the excessive API calls that trigger the rate limit.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, after encountering a 429 error, users can wait approximately 5 minutes for the rate limit to reset, after which Jira becomes usable again.</description><createDate>2025-02-19T18:30:14.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Reusing an attachment in ADF content on Jira’s REST API results in a file format error</summary><key>JRACLOUD-93305</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-93305</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (no)&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue occurs when trying to reuse (POST) an attachment in an ADF payload with a different user. The request fails with a "We don't recognize the format of a file you added or the data in it" error, even though the file is accessible by both users in the UI.&#xd;

 # Create a comment with an attachment with {*}User A{*}.&#xd;
 # Retrieve the ADF contents of the comment using {{{}/rest/api/3/issue/&lt;issue-id>/{}}}.&#xd;
 # With {*}User B{*}, use POST {{/rest/api/3/issue}} to create an issue with the retrieved ADF content.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira Cloud's text fields have a limit to the number of chars they can store&#xd;
* Single-line: 255 characters max&#xd;
* Paragraph: 32700 characters max&#xd;
&#xd;
When users try to enter content that exceeds the limits they will see error messages like the following one&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
We couldn't update the X value&#xd;
&#xd;
You can try again in a few minutes, or refresh the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
Try editing the field again&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 !Screenshot 2025-03-27 at 5.02.06 PM.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
That gives the idea the field has simply ran into an unexpected behaviour and entering the same value would work.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. How to replicate&#xd;
&#xd;
* Copy a content that has more than 32700 chars and try to paste it into a paragraph field (also works with *Description*)&#xd;
* Click on Save after pasting the content&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected result&#xd;
&#xd;
You will see an error message stating that the limit of chars was exceeded and will be able to edit the content you entered.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual result&#xd;
&#xd;
You see that misleading error message and the content is simply lost, the field will revert to the value prior to the edit attempt&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workarounds&#xd;
&#xd;
In case you run into that error message, check the amount of chars you are trying to enter into the field.</description><createDate>2025-02-18T12:39:29.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>JSON import build fails due to change history id</summary><key>JRACLOUD-93276</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-93276</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
Creating child issue in parent issue from project list view hides the child from the parent issue view until a refresh is done.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to a Jira Software project *List* view&#xd;
 # Create or click on an *Epic* (ensure the issue is viewed in-page)&#xd;
 # Click on *Add -> Child issue* and create a child&#xd;
 # Observe the child issue entry in the list. It is shown temporarily before it is removed.&#xd;
 # A refresh of the page will have the child issue shown properly.&#xd;
&#xd;
Another behavior reported:&#xd;
While having the *List* view grouped by Assignee, creating a child issue in an Epic in the foreground will cause the Epic in *List* view in the background to get removed from the view until a refresh is performed.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The newly created child issue should be shown and not removed after it shows up temporarily.&#xd;

Thanks for reporting this. As of December 17th 2024, the root cause is still being worked on. &#xd;
&#xd;
In the meantime, we  have rolled out a different screen on the timeline when this situation occurs.&#xd;
On this screen a project admin can fix the configuration of the project with the click of a button.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2024-12-12-16-32-12-628.png|width=531,height=284!&#xd;
&#xd;
Note: There is a very rare case where Fix my timeline will not work and display an error flag with the message {_}The filter must have project scope{_}. In this scenario the change cannot be applied safely as the configuration of the project was altered in unexpected way. If this happens please open a support ticket.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After updating the project key on a project, it's now possible to delete the original project key and release it to be reused. ([https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Cloud-Admins-articles/Announcing-the-ability-to-unlink-previously-used-project-keys/ba-p/2814789])&#xd;
&#xd;
However, doing this breaks the project timeline view in *team-managed software* projects. It shows the generic "Timelines are designed for a single project" message seen in company-managed boards if the board filter includes multiple projects.&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens because the *board filter* for the project isn't updated with the new key, it keeps the original key. Once the key is released, it doesn't redirect to that project anymore and the timeline isn't able to resolve the project.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to *Project settings* > *Details* on team-managed software project&#xd;
 # Change the *Project key* to a new key&#xd;
 # Under {*}Previous project keys{*}, delete the _original_ project key and save the change.&#xd;
 # Go to the *Timeline* view&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The timeline continues to show issues from the current project normally&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The timeline shows a message implying that the board filter includes multiple projects, and needs to be edited to only show one. (The filter for a team-managed project cannot be edited, and for new projects can't even be viewed.)&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Changing the project key back to the original key makes the timeline work normally again.&#xd;
Additional info&#xd;
To resolve board filter issues related to the Manage Sprints permission, revert to the original project key and then change it to the new project key you wish to use. This process will register the original project key as a previous project key, ensuring the board filter functions correctly once again.</description><createDate>2024-10-03T02:07:38.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Duplicate of this ticket: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-27277</text><author>Rain Holloway</author></comments><comments><text>Reopened this bug.&#xd;

It was originally closed as a duplicate of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-27398 but after investigation it appears that the symptoms in that report are related to a different board component, and resolve on their own after a short period of time.&#xd;
&#xd;
The timeline error persists until the orignal key is reassociated with the project, or the filter is updated by Atlassian support, so it needs a separate bug report.</text><author>Eleanor Thomasson</author></comments><comments><text>would love to see this bug fixed. epic panel is broken in backlog when old project key is deleted</text><author>Bryan</author></comments><comments><text>[~6662d5908bb1] Clicking on `Fix my timeline` on the healthcheck screen should resolve the issue for both the timeline and epic panel.

Could either of you clarify who would be responsible for this bug?  I would like to raise severity level higher on this ticket due to the bug making the report completely inaccurate.  Thanks!&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If the board JQL filter includes "component" and there are multiple components with the same name across different projects, issue creation will fail with "Component id 'XXXXX' is not valid" (shown in developer tools).&#xd;
&#xd;
There was a similar bug reported for the Timeline view, which seems to be still present for the Board view - [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-25411] &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Have a component sharing the same name (not case-sensitive) across at least two projects.&#xd;
 # The board filter in the affected project is configured to include the very same component.&#xd;
 # Try to create an issue directly from the board, using the '+ Create Issue' button.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is created with the component used by the board filter.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is not created, an error "Something went wrong" is thrown in the UI, while the developer tools show "Component id 'XXXXX' is not valid" (XXXXX stands for the wrong component id, coming from a different project).&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Create issues using the 'Create' button on the navigation bar, making sure to select the right Component.&#xd;
 # Rename the component coming from the other project to anything else, for instance, 'Offboarded' to 'Offboarded2'.&#xd;
 # Use the ID of the given component in your board filter, instead of using the name of the component.</description><createDate>2024-09-09T12:34:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>As another workaround You can use component_id instead of component_name in filter JQL.&#xd;

&#xd;
Would be great if we could get an update where you can see the component id from a UI stand-point, like in the Edit pop-up of the component</text><author>Alex Chadwick</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Unable to create issues from Plan when the issues are Grouped by Releases</summary><key>JRACLOUD-89810</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-89810</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When trying to create an issue from the Advanced Roadmaps plan after Grouping the issues as per Releases, it fails with an error.&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug fixed by [JSWCLOUD\-23359: Unable to create issues from Plan when the issues are Grouped by Releases|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-23359] but currently it reoccurred.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Advanced Roadmaps Showing "1" Change to Review but No Changes.&#xd;
&#xd;
The customer keeps getting the Review = 1 as you can see in the screenshots but they do not have anything for review. The was a Bug created for the same behavior/discrepancy and the solution was implemented but the customer still has the same issue.&#xd;
!Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 5.54.22 PM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In a plan, create a dependency between two issues as a scenario change&#xd;
 # Create any scenario change for any issue that is not one of the issues above&#xd;
 # Remove one of the issues out of plan resource (other project) from step 1&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The change for review should show 0. No changes&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It will leave 1 change for review if the custom field is a multi-value. The Advance Roadmaps continue indicating 1 change for review.&#xd;
h2. Workaround&#xd;
h3. Cloud:&#xd;
 # Navigate to the plan&#xd;
 # Click on Plan Settings > Scenarios (If it's not enabled, please enable it)&#xd;
 # Create a new scenario (If there's already one, please proceed to the next step)&#xd;
 # Create another scenario > Create from _Copy of Initial Scenario_ for backup purposes.&#xd;
 # Create another Scenario but this time, create with blank scenario&#xd;
 # There should be now a scenario without "ghost changes" (the blank scenario)&#xd;
 # Delete the other scenario and use the blank scenario that has no "Ghost changes"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Server:&#xd;
&#xd;
*WARNING:* This will remove ALL uncommitted changes for the plan. Make sure you commit/revert all your changes prior to attempting this.&#xd;
&#xd;
There is a hidden plan configuration screen that allows for resetting all pending changes (including but not limited to the phantom ones). This will make the phantom changes go away. This configuration screen can be accessed as follows:&#xd;
 # Enable the com.atlassian.portfolio.plan.ExtendedAdministration dark feature on the JIRA instance.&#xd;
 # Visit the plan configuration screen (open the plan, click the three-dot menu next to the plan name, then choose Configure).&#xd;
 # Click on the new Extended Administration section in the column on the left (the dark feature makes this visible).&#xd;
 # Confirm that you want to reset uncommitted changes.</description><createDate>2021-08-13T15:15:38.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Same issue here.

When we click on the assignee field for an issue in an Advanced Roadmap plan, the drop-down will show and allow us to select all the users (including the ones without Assinable user permission or even non-license user).

 # Create a plan with some project issues in it.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If you go to the *Global View All Issues* page, where you can filter your search using Basic Search in Jira, the search converts to an advanced search after viewing a ticket from the results. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Go to Filters > View All Issues > Apply a filter on the Project and any other column(for example, Status) > Now, view any of the Jira issues from the search result > Hit the back button from the browser > The Basic option will be greyed out(You can't switch to basic as the query is too complex or is invalid).&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira waits for the user to type the full issue key to search and return any results, correct results or an error without changing to advanced search JQL automatically.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
This conversion blocks the option to revert back to the basic search as the Basic option is greyed out.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
After viewing the ticket, if the Basic search option is Greyed out, then manually refresh the browser to be able to see the Basic option again.&#xd;

I'm pleased to announce that I am working on a fix to improve language support in our preview generation. This fix will configure our preview generation to use the [Noto|https://fonts.google.com/noto] font (due to its support of all writing systems and open licence) as a fallback font if the document's font is not available.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The *+/rest/api/3/issue/\{issueIdOrKey}/notify+* API sends multiple email notifications for the same issue to users who belong to several recipient categories.&#xd;
&#xd;
For instance, if someone is both the assignee and in watcher list, they will receive two email notifications for the same issue. This has led customers to believe this is a bug, as they expect to receive only one notification per issue, regardless of how many recipient categories they belong to. As a result, this causes dissatisfaction because users feel overwhelmed by redundant notifications.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
To reproduce the issue, add a user to multiple recipient categories(watcher, assignee, voter), and run the following API:&#xd;
 * [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-notify-post]&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
We expect users to receive one email notification only when they belong to multiple recipient categories for the same issue.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Users are receiving multiple email notifications on an issue if they belong to multiple recipient categories for the same issue.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using the [Wiki Style Renderer] for text fields, the text editing toolbar behaves unexpectedly by not remaining fixed at the top during editing sessions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Tested browsers Chrome, Safari and Firefox on both Windows and MacOS&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;

 # Enter information into the text field and save.&#xd;
 ##  observe that the text editor toolbar remains static at the top.&#xd;
 # Reload the page again and edit the Text field.&#xd;
 # During this editing session, the text editor toolbar moves while scrolling, obscuring parts of the text.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The text editor toolbar should remain stationary at the top of the editor to ensure text visibility isn't obstructed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;

&#xd;
I'm pleased to announce that I am working on a fix to improve language support in our preview generation. This fix will configure our preview generation to use the [Noto|https://fonts.google.com/noto] font (due to its support of all writing systems and open licence) as a fallback font if the document's font is not available.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
On an organization with  a large user and group directory and is on the unified user management, provisioning a new Jira site may take awhile to complete. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. On an organization with the unified user management, setup a large user and group directory. For example &#xd;
 - 100,000 users&#xd;
 - 2000 groups &#xd;
&#xd;
2. Go the organization administration and navigate Products > Add Products. &#xd;
3. Choose Jira&#xd;
4. Choose to create a new site&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The new Jira site should be available to the admins within a reasonable amount of time. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The large directory will need to sync completely to the new Jira site and this may take awhile. &#xd;
Once the directory fully syncs to Jira, the new site will be available. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Wait for awhile for the new site to be made available. You can also contact Atlassian support to help check on the status of the new site. </description><createDate>2024-07-03T08:20:57.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Issue Security Scheme continues affecting some issues despite having been removed from project</summary><key>JRACLOUD-84067</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-84067</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If you disassociate an issue security scheme from a project and then delete it, it doesn't actually remove that issue security level from the issue, which renders the issue inaccessible.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Cloud: Yes (Random)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new issue security scheme and level&#xd;
 # Associate that issue security scheme with a project and associate the issue security level with an issue.&#xd;
 # When you disassociate the issue security scheme from the project and check the DB, some issues will still have security.&#xd;
 # You won't be able to access issues that still have security set.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issues have no security level and anyone can see it.&#xd;
&#xd;
*security* column should be null in the DB for the issues.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Some issues will still have security set and won't be accessible.&#xd;
&#xd;
*security* column will not be null in the DB for these issues.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the below DB query to set the security column value to null.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
update jiraissue set security = null where security in (select distinct security from jiraissue where security not in (select id from schemeissuesecuritylevels ) and security is not null and pkey='&lt;Project Key>'); {code}</description><createDate>2024-06-21T14:06:08.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Historical JQL searches return wrong results</summary><key>JRACLOUD-84058</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-84058</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:title=Environment}&#xd;
(!) Customers that migrated from Server to Cloud *recently* (After March 2024).&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
Customers might experience trouble running historical JQL searches using *WAS/WAS IN* with *BEFORE/AFTER/DURING/ON*.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Run one of the following example JQLs:&#xd;
 ## status *WAS* closed *DURING* ('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31')&#xd;
 ## assignee *WAS* currentUser() *AFTER/BEFORE* startOfYear(-1)&#xd;
 ## priority *WAS* P1 *ON* '2024-01-01'&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Issues within the date range and condition are returned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
In some cases, the historical JQL search will return additional issues or no issues. Issues that had value _X_ set to _&lt;field>_ before A but it has been later (before A) changed. &#xd;
This is caused by corrupted data in the history of some issues. Only JQL is affected, as that data is only used by the search engine.&#xd;

I am curious: why was the priority of this defect just changed from High to Low when the status shows it is "in progress"?&#xd;
&#xd;
Is this a "smell" that this defect will not actually be fixed once and for all for Jira Cloud, and instead closed with the dreaded "Won't do" or moved to "Future Consideration"?  This symptom is also a problem with new Jira Cloud sites (i.e., not migrated) after the first Team-managed project is added to a site.  The scope is certainly larger than migration from Server to Cloud.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The error "The scheme cannot be deleted when there are projects associated with it" is shown when trying to delete Permission Scheme associated with the projects.&#xd;
&#xd;
As per [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-permissions/] projects associated with permission scheme should fall back to default permission scheme.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a non-default permission scheme&#xd;
 # Associate project with the permission scheme&#xd;
 # Delete the Permission scheme&#xd;
 # Observe the error&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Permission scheme associated with one or more projects os deleted and those projects fall back to using the *Default Permission Scheme* as outlined in [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-permissions/].&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The error "The scheme cannot be deleted when there are projects associated with it" is shown&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Identify projects which are using this Permission Scheme and assign to different permission scheme.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If a _request type_ that's currently in use is deleted, the issues remain associated to them on background.&#xd;
e.g.: The JQL "request type is empty" won't return those issues because the association with the deleted _request type_ still exist.&#xd;

 # Create a JSD request&#xd;
 # Delete the associated _request type_&#xd;
 # Search for "request type is empty" and the issue won't be returned.&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The association between issues and the deleted request types is removed.&#xd;

&#xd;
I'm a developer on the Jira Service Management team that's responsible for make sure attachments work as they should. Thank you for reporting this bug – and I'm sorry that it's causing you some pain. Also, my apologies for not replying sooner, I missed that this was assigned to us.&#xd;
&#xd;
I was able to confirm that the automation rule indeed is not being fired when dragging and dropping a file onto an issue, however I also was unable to get the rule to run when adding the attachment via the paperclip icon – so I'm wondering if something might have changed there, too. Could you please confirm whether that is still working for you? In the meantime I'll update the status of this issue to Gathering Impact to reflect that we'll see how many more teams are experiencing this issue.&#xd;

I apologize for the delay.  I am on vacation this week, but I had a few minutes to do a couple of tests. &#xd;
&#xd;
I created a new ticket for testing EMSD-26323. Please note that this ticket type has a response automation trigger.  It is called "Onboard - Attachment Trigger"&#xd;
&#xd;
I attached a file using the paper clip and I received an email confirmation. See attached PDF&#xd;
&#xd;
I then attached a file using drag and drop and I didn't receive an email confirmation.&#xd;

Can someone give me some sort of update on this?  </text><author>Patrick Girgenti</author></comments><comments><text>I spent some time investigating this issue. The thing is that it's different in the old issue view and in the new issue view.&#xd;
h3. Old issue view&#xd;
&#xd;
When you add an attachment, no matter from where, Jira fires an "issue_updated" event with a changelog, having the 'Attachment' field changes:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Changelog: [id:29048657, items:[[field:Attachment, fieldtype:jira, fieldId:attachment, from:null, fromString:null, to:965187, toString:chrome_7Vj5qYcUAp.gif]]] {code}&#xd;
h3. New issue view&#xd;
&#xd;
The only place to add an attachment is a comment. But instead of the issue_updated event, an 'attachment_created' event is fired.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
I can see two issues here:&#xd;
 # The issue_updated event is not fired and changelog is not updated - the automation can't catch a change of the 'attachment' field.&#xd;
 # Even if I try to use the 'attachment_created' in our automation, this event doesn't have the issue key!&#xd;
&#xd;
That being said, in the new issue view, it's not possible to have an automation based on attachment change.</text><author>Andrey Kiyanovskiy</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Jira team,&#xd;

&#xd;
As a workaround, you can use an "{*}Issue commented{*}" detect whenever a comment contains common file extensions meaning that an attachment was added to it. Please see the idea below:&#xd;
&#xd;
The rule should have the "{*}Issue commented{*}" trigger instead of the "{*}Field value changed{*}", since attachments are added via comment:&#xd;
&#xd;
Then after the trigger, add a "Smart values" condition with the following configuration:&#xd;
 * {*}First value{*}: &#xd;
&#xd;
{\{issue.comments.last.body}}&#xd;
 * {*}Condition{*}: Contains regular expression&#xd;
 * {*}Regular expression{*}:&#xd;
&#xd;
(.png|.jpeg|.pdf|.jpg)&#xd;
&#xd;
With this trigger, you can detect the new attachment added to the ticket&#xd;

Backlashes "\" are being removed from comments and descriptions hyperlinks in Jira.&#xd;

Replicable by sending an email with the link to JSM mail handler, or having an integration from OpsGenie to JSM that creates tickets from alerts. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
A race condition occurs when a manual loop transition coincides with an automated transition sequence, leading to an unintended and incorrect issue status change. This issue is particularly evident when an agent manually triggers a loop transition at the same time an automation rule is executing a series of status changes. This can result in the issue unexpectedly landing in a status that does not have a direct transition path defined in the workflow.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # An agent selects a loop transition on an issue, which is intended to transition the issue to its current status.&#xd;
 # Concurrently, an automation rule is triggered, which aims to transition the issue through a sequence of statuses (e.g., "Status A" -> "Status B" -> original status).&#xd;
 # While the automation is processing these transitions, the agent attempts to manually use the loop transition.&#xd;
 # The issue ends up in an unexpected status due to the race condition, bypassing the workflow’s defined transition paths.&#xd;
&#xd;
_{*}Note{*}: Reproducing this issue is challenging due to its dependency on precise timing between manual and automated actions._&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue should transition according to the workflow paths defined, without the possibility of bypassing direct transition paths, regardless of simultaneous automation rules or manual transitions.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue may transition to a status without a direct transition path defined in the workflow, indicating a race condition that permits an unintended status change.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Error Messages and Logs:*&#xd;
&#xd;
No specific error messages are displayed. The anomaly is evident in the issue history, with the issue moving from one status to another without a defined transition path for that step.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: no&#xd;
&#xd;
The bug affects all the users trying to copy/paste images from a private source, such as a received email in Gmail with pictures attached inline with the email. When pasting such private images into the description of a new Jira issue, or a comment on a existing Jira issue, the private image will appear properly and there is no indication that it will show as "{*}Preview unavailable{*}" to others (or you at a later time) because it is private.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Send email to yourself using Gmail web and attach picture in-line&#xd;
 # Open email and copy an image from your private Gmail account using your keyboard.&#xd;
 # Paste that image in the issue description&#xd;
 # Create the issue or paste the content in the comment of an existing issue&#xd;
&#xd;
Additional information:&#xd;
 * When you copy images from places like a received Gmail email, the image itself is not copied to the clipboard. Rather a private URL to the image is copied which is viewable to you but inaccessible to others for security reasons. This is an industry standard restriction and not Atlassian specific.&#xd;
 * If email you are pasting pics from has pictures loaded via external links (e.g. mail list) then picture will be attached properly to the issue.&#xd;
 * If email has private pics attached to the email (e.g. you receive email with pic attached), then the issue is reproducible.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There is a visual error indication to the user when private images are pasted into a Jira description or comment. Ideally there also will be some guidance in the error on how to copy the image directly so it is visible for all.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The private image will appear properly and there is no indication that it will show as "{*}Preview unavailable{*}" to others (or you at a later time) because it is private.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
You can download the file and then use the "Files &amp; images" button in the editor toolbar to upload the media.</description><createDate>2024-05-07T05:51:58.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi everyone,&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
jira:issue_created webhook doesn't contain "parent" field information when a sub-task is created in a team-managed project.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# configure a webhook to send jira:issue_created event&#xd;
# create a sub-task in a team-managed project and check the webhook payload&#xd;
# create another sub-task in a company-managed project and check the webhook payload&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
both payload should have "parent" field&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
only the webhook related to company-managed project contains "parent" field. Here's a sample. &#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
{&#xd;
	...&#xd;
	parent: {&#xd;
	id: $id,&#xd;
	key: $issue_key,&#xd;

}&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
h4. Workaround 1&#xd;
The issue_created event fires before the sub-tasks parent field is set and as a result, the webhook doesn't contain it. A subsequent issue_update happens immediately after that sets the parent field. Thus, subscribing to issue_updated webhook in this scenario will send the parent field in the issue_update webhook body.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Workaround 2&#xd;
As a workaround, we can make /rest/api/2/issue/${issue_key} call based on the webhook response to get the parent data.</description><createDate>2024-04-08T03:47:22.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Parent field inconsistency in create screen and transition screen</summary><key>JRACLOUD-83433</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-83433</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Problem&#xd;
We are seeing some inconsistency in the way the parent issues are shown.&#xd;
In create/edit screen, the parent field shows the issue number and then the summary, while in a transition screen, it shows the summary and then the issue number.&#xd;
This is creating issues when customer is creating automation scripts.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Jira Software&#xd;
.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
* Create an issue in the project. try to add a parent through the parent field&#xd;
* The parent field shows the issue number and then the summary&#xd;
* Next create a transition and add a screen in a workflow from one status to another.&#xd;
* Publish the workflow.&#xd;
* Try to move an issue for this transition on the board.&#xd;
* On the screen, try filling up the parent field.&#xd;
* it shows the summary and then the issue number.&#xd;

In both screens it should be the same order -> the issue number and then the summary&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When an issue is transitioned to Closed from the portal and a comment is added, this triggers an automation that re-opens the issue when commented. Now it leads to a race condition where Jira is closing an issue while automation is re-opening it and it messes up the Issue History despite the right events being performed by Jira&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Add a customer transition to Resolved status as shown in [Show a workflow transition in the portal|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/show-a-workflow-transition-in-the-portal/]&#xd;
 # Create an automation that would re-open a ticket(move to IN Progress) when a comment is added in Resolved status.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Parent field displays results out of the screen in the Issue Create screen the first time it is open&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# In an issue create screen, set the Parent field as the last or near the last fields on the list.&#xd;
# Press the Create issue button, and on the Issue creation dialog, scroll down until you see the Parent field, and click on it. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The list of possible parents is displayed, and if the list hits the lower edge of the screen, it will show upward instead so it can be used normally.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The first time we click on it, it displays out of the screen:&#xd;

&#xd;
Note: if the Parent field is not the last field on the screen field list, it always expands downward, which results in some options being partially out of the screen. &#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
* We can click over it again to collapse it, and then click once more so it will appear upwards, as expected, requiring 3 clicks instead of 1 to get the expected result&#xd;
* Placing the Parent higher on the screen location can help.</description><createDate>2024-03-29T19:11:49.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Visual issue with starred projects</summary><key>JRACLOUD-83424</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-83424</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If an *Incoming Mail Handler* is setup with a *Mail Server* that uses an +email added as a user in the instance+, the Mail Handler malfunctions, and the following behaviors were observed:&#xd;
* The Default Reporter used in the setup is not respected. The sender is added as Reporter instead. &#xd;
If the user from the Mail Server is used as *Default Reporter*, the following additional malfunctions are observed:&#xd;
* CC Assignee option doesn't assign the created issue to the user whose email was on the CC field of the email sent to Jira.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to System > Incoming Mail > Create a Mail Server (address@example.com)&#xd;
 # Add the email used in the Mail Server (address@example.com) as a licensed user in Jira.&#xd;
# Create an Incoming Mail Handler using the Mail Server (address@example.com) and add the user (address@example.com) as Default Reporter. Select the option *CC Assignee: true* &#xd;
# Send an email to the Mail Server address (address@example.com) and add your own address in CC field.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
An issue is created in the target project with you as assignee and the user from address@example.com as Reporter.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
An issue is created and address@example.com is set as assignee and the sender is the Reporter instead of the Default Reporter set in the Mail Handler. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available</description><createDate>2024-03-22T17:12:31.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - April 2, 2025|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
Issue creation gets stuck when leaving the Issue creation page open for some time. Usually, when opening the issue creation dialog, it is possible to leave the window open and add the information required, as well as attachments over time, but when some time passes by, it becomes more and more likely that adding an attachment will malfunction, the "Create" button will become disabled and the issue creation will have to be restarted, losing all the values added into the issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Open the issue creation dialog. &#xd;
# Add some information into its fields, and leave the dialog open for more than 15-17 minutes.&#xd;
# Drag and drop an attachment to the issue creation dialog&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The attachment is added and the issue creation can continue as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The attachment appears in the dialog, but it is not shown to have an upload progress bar and the Create button gets disabled with a loading animation as if the attachment was being uploaded, but it never finishes:&#xd;
 !Attachment stuck loading.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
Note: the more time passes, the more this is likely to occur.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Create the issue first with the minimum of information necessary, and add the attachments and other information over time in the issue created.</description><createDate>2024-03-15T15:19:01.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Filter search endpoint fails for complex JQL searches with expand.</summary><key>JRACLOUD-83252</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-83252</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
We've encountered an issue after executing a migration using Jira Cloud Migration Assistant (JCMA). The context for the "Story Point" issue type is incorrect, resulting in bugs that affect the display of story points in the backlog.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Here are the steps that we followed which led to the issue:&#xd;
 # Navigate to your Jira site and select "Settings" followed by "Issues".&#xd;
 # Under "Custom field", search for "Story Point".&#xd;
 # Click on the three-dot icon (…) and select "Context and default Value".&#xd;
 # Capture a screenshot of the current settings for reference.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the other site to execute the migration.&#xd;
 # In Jira, go to "Settings" and select "Migrate Cloud Site".&#xd;
 # Click on "Go dashboard" and choose "Create a new migration".&#xd;
 # Follow the provided steps and migrate one "company management project".&#xd;
 # Once the migration is complete, return to the first site.&#xd;
 # Repeat steps 1 to 3.&#xd;
&#xd;
After this process, we found that a new context was created, but it doesn't include any issue types.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The context should *always* have issue types &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
 * The sprint sorting is done in backend by compounding {{sequenceid}} and {{id}} of the sprint with *priority* to {{sequenceid}}&#xd;
 * In new cloud, {{sequenceid}} column is null by default and is generated when an ordering is done in the board&#xd;
 * When fetching the sprints, backend does this :  *{{{}sequenceid{}}}={{{}sequenceid==null?sprintid{}}}*&#xd;
&#xd;
 * This orders the list in unfriendly ways because the {{id}} of sprints in the cloud for this customer has started to *overlap* with {{sequenceid}} of older sprints in the server. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Create project and board&#xd;
 * Add sprints to the board and complete them&#xd;
 * Verify sprint order in burndown chart on Jira Server&#xd;
 * Run S2C migration&#xd;
 * Verify sprint order in burndown chart on Jira cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Burn-down chart displays sprints in the same order as the server after S2C migration. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Sprint order is burndown chart is not same as that in the server which leads to newer sprints going down in the dropdown. Since customer can't find their sprints at the top of the dropdown, they feel that the sprint is not migrated whereas it can be found somewhere at the end of the list. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Additional Context&#xd;
Users may also identify this when creating new sprints after the migration. Sprint name suggestions don't increment as expected after the migration of Jira project that has an active sprint.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, the workaround for this issue is to modify the *AO_60DB71_SPRINT* table to restore the Sprint ordering. &#xd;
&#xd;

1. Existing Sprints in Cloud.&#xd;
2. Migrated Ordered Sprints in order of their sequence id.&#xd;
3. Migrated UnOrdered Sprints in order of their ids. (Since sequence id is null in this case)&#xd;
&#xd;
Looked into the doc - [https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MigPT/pages/2037342171/Sequence+Id+mismatch+issue]&#xd;
The solutions mentioned don't seem to make sure the above mentioned desired sprint ordering after migration.&#xd;
In order to achieve the desired ordering as mentioned above, we would need id/sequence id for already existing cloud entities as well in which case it is not a JCMA migration change alone.&#xd;

This behavior leads to emails being processed by the wrong handlers, causing confusion and additional workload as they have to manually move these wrongly classified emails.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up two mail handlers in Jira - one with a specific Catch Email Address and another without any specified recipient.&#xd;
 # Send test emails directly or CC'd to the specific Catch Email Address.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The 'handler with catch mail address' should process all incoming mails sent directly or CC'd to its specified Catch Email Address while other mails not directed at this address should be handled by the 'Catch-all' handler.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All incoming emails are being caught by the 'handler with no catch mail address' regardless of whether they were sent directly or CC'd to the catch mail, which was set as the Catch Email.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. &#xd;
&#xd;
The customer also suggests that these rules should be clearly documented in the Jira documentation for better understanding and implementation by users.</description><createDate>2023-12-21T18:06:40.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Incorrect results using JQL "&lt;=" or ">=" on Target End and Target Start fields</summary><key>JRACLOUD-82596</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-82596</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using JQL searches to compare the "Target Start" and "Target End" date fields ( from Advanced Roadmaps ), it does return the correct result if using the "&lt;=" comparison, and the user time zone is not in UTC.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example,&#xd;
&#xd;
Search for "Target End" &lt;= "2023-12-21" will only return issues matching "2023-12-20" or before.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
h4. For >= operator&#xd;
 # Set the Target start field to 02/02/2024 in an issue&#xd;
 # Set your account time so to America/Los Angeles&#xd;
 # Search for issues with query *"Target start" >= '2024-01-02'*&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. For &lt;= operator&#xd;
 # Set the Target start field to 02/02/2024 in an issue&#xd;
 # Set your account time so to Europe/Berlin&#xd;
 # Search for issues with query *"Target start" &lt;= '2024-01-02'*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Issues are returned including the end date mentioned in the search.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Issues returned exclude the end date mentioned in the search and only include issues from the day -1 &#xd;
h3. Workaround 1&#xd;
h4. For >= operator&#xd;
&#xd;
Search with one day in the past of the actual wanted date. For our example this would be *"Target start" >= '2024-01-01'*&#xd;
h4. For &lt;= operator&#xd;
&#xd;
Search with one day in the future of the actual wanted date. For our example this would be *"Target start" &lt;= '2024-01-03'*&#xd;
**&#xd;
h3. Workaround 2&#xd;
&#xd;
Filter out the date and specify the hh:mm . Example :{*}"Target start" &lt;= '2024-01-03 23:59'{*}&#xd;
&#xd;
This works for both &lt;= and >= operator.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
A problem arises when a label custom field is added in a Team-Managed project with several Default labels that, when combined, exceed the 255-character limit (even if none of the labels exceed this value individually). The layout does not update correctly after this action. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Create a Team-Managed project.&#xd;
2. Go to Project Settings > Issue Types. Add a label custom field to the project.&#xd;
3. In this label custom field, add several default labels such that their combined character count exceeds 255 characters. Save your Issue Layout.&#xd;
4. Attempt to update any other field in the Issue Layout.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Issue Layout should update correctly even if the combined character count of the labels exceeds 255 characters.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Issue Layout does not update correctly. An error message is displayed: "We couldn't update the 'Task' issue type. Refresh and try again."&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Remove some (or all) of these default labels in the label custom field so that the total character count does not exceed 255 characters. This should allow the Issue Layout to update without any significant problems.</description><createDate>2023-11-29T13:12:13.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Deleting a project role or group will cause comments with visibility restricted to that role / group to be inaccessible</summary><key>JRACLOUD-82409</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-82409</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When performing a request to the Find users REST API endpoint [User search Jira API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-user-search#api-rest-api-3-user-search-get] by inserting the email address on the query parameter erroneously, the response of the endpoint still returns the result. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is because of the following logic: when an email address is recognized as invalid a possible user error/mistake is taken into account and therefore the email address is tokenized and the different tokens are used to try to match full name or display name fields. So, the result is returned in case one of the name fields matches one of the tokens, but this is not clearly documented.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
*Test 1*&#xd;
# Perform a request to the endpoint using an email with '123' at the end:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
/rest/api/3/user/search?startAt=0&amp;maxResults=50&amp;query=something@email.com123  {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
*Test 2*&#xd;
# Add user with invalid sub-domain&#xd;
## add test user - {{atlassiantestemailwithinvaliddo@gmail.com.del}} to your site&#xd;
## Search this user using API, user won't be returned:&#xd;
{code} /rest/api/3/user/search?query=atlassiantestemailwithinvaliddo@gmail.com.del {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
*Test 3*&#xd;
# Add test user - {{atlassiantestemailwithinvaliddo@gmail.com.xyz}} to your site&#xd;
# API search will work fine&#xd;
&#xd;
*Test 4*&#xd;
# Add test user with more than 31 character email address and invalid domain&#xd;
# API won't return this user. If user base is huge, API will return a larger list of users&#xd;
&#xd;
*Test 5*&#xd;
# Add a test user with special character in email address "-" and lengthy text&#xd;
# e.g atlassian_20221207_test_alpha.beta@test-domain.com.del&#xd;
# User search won't work&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
# API should return empty result if there is no matching email&#xd;
# API should avoid tokenising the search string if the search pattern in having email syntax&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
If one of the name fields matches or include 'something' the search will still return the information.&#xd;
Also, inconsistent results are received if input has invalid email address (sub-domain), even though email is added to the site.&#xd;

&#xd;
Although the summary of this ticket mentions that the bug appears in a group custom field, I think it's more than just that.&#xd;
&#xd;
From our own experience, when editing a +workflow+ and adding a new +condition+ of type "{*}User Is In Group Custom Field{*}", the items shown in the field selection menu not only include just those single-group picker fields or just multi-group picker fields, but also those fields of all selection related types (single-choice selections, multi-choice selection, cascaded fields, checkboxes, radio buttons). Since our site has so many fields of various different selection types, there are totally several hundreds of fields show up in such menu where in fact we just want to pick one from only a handful of group picker fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
The situation is worsen by the fact that such menu also does not sort its item at all. Imagine we have to pick one from several hundreds and they are in an random order. It's quite a pain to find a right one. This is a perfect example of "swiss cheese model", if either of these 2 bug is solved (bad sorting order and unrelated fields show in the list), the user experience of the workflow editor would be improved a lot. There is a different ticket about the sorting order problem: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-26308&#xd;

 # Create a new Jira Software site by following the steps outlined [here|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/add-a-new-product-to-your-organization/#Add-a-product-to-a-new-site].&#xd;
 # Access the sub-tasks configuration page by navigating to *Settings* (⚙️) > *Issues* > {*}Sub-tasks{*}.&#xd;
 # Observe that the sub-tasks are *turned off* by default.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The sub-tasks should be enabled by default as indicated in [the documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-sub-tasks/#Enable-or-disable-sub-task-issue-types].&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The sub-tasks are, in fact, disabled by default, which contradicts the expected behavior.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To address this issue, you can manually [enable sub-tasks|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-sub-tasks/#Enable-or-disable-sub-task-issue-types] from the sub-tasks configuration page by navigating to *Settings* (⚙️) > *Issues* > {*}Sub-tasks{*}.</description><createDate>2023-09-26T08:19:33.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>CSV import does not respect the selection for new user mapping</summary><key>JRACLOUD-81992</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-81992</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
While importing issue details from CSV, a new user is prompted with the choice if they want to keep users inactive which can be later changed from User Management.&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user opts for the INACTIVE user option, instead of creating inactive users, Jira is creating active users with product access.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Export CSV file containing issue details from the below link - https://&lt;your_site>/secure/admin/ExternalImport1.jspa&#xd;
 # Select CSV import and select CSV file you want to import. The CSV file should contain a user having an email address that doesn't exist on the site&#xd;
 # Map the user details to any user information fields (e.g Reporter, Assignee, etc)&#xd;
 # When you reach to below screen, select 1st or 2nd option. It will create active user with ALL default product access. Both the options are not working as expected.  !image-2023-09-04-16-49-53-373.png|width=361,height=78!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
An inactive user should be created if you use 1st option or user with selected product option should be created in case you choose second option.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Active user is getting created with ALL default product access.&#xd;

*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Cloud*. Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-64599].&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue Created Event is not triggered when issue are created from CSV using External System Import (documentation: [importing data from csv|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/importing-data-from-csv-776636762.html]). The issue updated event is fired instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
This makes it impossible to trigger automation rules, notifications or webhooks for issues created this way.&#xd;
&#xd;
When bulk creating issues from CSV  (documentation: [create issues using the csv importer|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/create-issues-using-the-csv-importer/]) the issue created event is correctly fired.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Webhook that fires on issue_created and issue_updated events and send the data to [beeceptor|https://beeceptor.com/], [webhooks.site|https://webhook.site/], [postbin|https://postb.in/], or other similar tools&#xd;
 # Bulk create some issues from CSV ([create issues using the csv importer|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/create-issues-using-the-csv-importer/])&#xd;
 # See that you have correctly received the issue_created Webhook&#xd;
 # Now repeat the test using External System Import instead ([importing data from csv|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/importing-data-from-csv-776636762.html])&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue_created webhook is received&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue_updated webhook is received instead.&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
This happens because the CSV External System Import is firing the issue updated event instead of the issue created event. The issue can also be reproduced using notifications or automation rules configured to be triggered on issue_updated event.&#xd;
&#xd;
From original description:&#xd;
{quote}I am creating an plugins which send and notification to our tool whenever an Issue is created. We are unable to trapped the Issue Created Event at the time of CSV import.&#xd;
&#xd;
Even We are unable to distinct the issue which are created using CSV import.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
For Issue Created event, use Bulk Create instead.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
From [Importing data from JSON|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/importing-data-from-json-776636779.html] document, it mentioned that we can set the status of the users when creating the new users (active: true/false).&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
"users": [ &#xd;
	{&#xd;
        "name" : "abcde-12345-fedcba",&#xd;

&#xd;
However, the users are always get created as active users on User Management even though we set the active status to false. Example:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
"users": [ &#xd;
	{&#xd;
        "name" : "abcde-456789-fedcba",&#xd;

 # Create a JSON file with active and inactive users. Example:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
"users": [ &#xd;

Summary
When importing issues from CSV, despite estimates being listed in seconds according to [Creating Issues using the CSV Importer|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACLOUD/Creating+issues+using+the+CSV+importer] and [Importing Data from CSV|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACLOUD/Importing+Data+from+CSV], if default unit for time tracking is set to *minutes*, it will be imported as minutes instead of hours.

h3. Environment
JIRA 6.5.*

h3. Steps to Reproduce
# Set Time Tracking default unit to Minutes (per [Configuring Time Tracking|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACLOUD/Configuring+Time+Tracking#ConfiguringTimeTracking-ConfiguringTimeTrackingSettings])
# On a JIRA instance, *Issues > Import from CSV*
# Import the attached CSV
# Check the imported issues. Original Estimate will show 14m instead of 14h.

h3. Expected Results
Importer would convert the seconds to minutes and then hours/days if necessary.

h3. Actual Results
The minutes are converted to hours and then labeled as minutes. The default unit should only be used if not specified.
 
h3. Notes
For example, Original Estimate is listed in CSV as 50400 seconds > 840 minutes > 14 hours
Importer converts the 14 hours back to minutes, by default.
Importer should know that 50400 is listed as seconds.

h3.Solution / Workaround
# Change [Default Time Tracking|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACLOUD/Configuring+Time+Tracking#ConfiguringTimeTracking-ConfiguringTimeTrackingSettings] unit to hours, and re-import the CSV issues.
# Confirm that Original Estimate shows correct time, and if desired, change the default time tracking back to minutes.</description><createDate>2016-09-30T09:15:10.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The possibility to use CC by-sa licensed works together with GPL
licensed works to form a derivative work of both would make my life a
lot easier.

It would allow me to use works from Ryzoom together with works from
Battle for Wesnoth in the free RPG books I work on.

And it would make it easier to work on the writings, the artwork and
the code for a game which uses the rules of the RPG for a tactical
computer-RPG without having to worry about falling into licensing
traps.

Finally I could license my own drawings and poems under CC by-sa,
which would make it much easier for others to reuse them, while
preserving my ability combine all derivatives of my works with my
other works - regardless of the kind of work (song, image, text or

possibility to reuse the improvements made to derivative in practice).

Now know where I stand - I hope I can contribute to making the
compatibility of CC attribution-sharealike and GPLv3 or later work
out!

I like the table - it makes the differences and similarities quite clear.

I have one nitpick on the comparison: For “other versions” it states
for the GPL:

    “Compliance with any version automatically permitted if no version
    specified; otherwise no by default, but licensor may specify that
    later/other versions allowable. No additional obligations are
    imposed on authors where a reuser follows a later version. (§§14)”

It would be nice to add, that the suggested license text allows any
later version, and that there is an option to select a proxy who can
decide for each later version whether the works may be used under this
version (clause 14). Additionally clause 13 allows using the AGPL
(which is a GPL with added copyleft protection for applications which
are accessed over the network - a requirement for providing copyleft
in remote services).,,,,</text><author>vivi yang</author></comments><comments><text>This also occurs in Jira Server.&#xd;

&#xd;
Using the import from CSV option in the Jira admin console to import CSV is working fine. Original Estimates and Time Remaining are coming in as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
And, if we give Original Estimates and Time Remaining in milliseconds (instead of seconds) and then use import option available under “Issues and filters” then it works. Original Estimates and Time Remaining come in as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
So conclusion is, if we use&#xd;
 * Import CSV option under Jira admin console then we need to provide Original Estimates and Time Remaining in *seconds.*&#xd;
 * For the Import CSV option under Issues and filters we need to provide Original Estimates and Time Remaining in *milliseconds.*&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When we import CSV data into JIRA via System External Import, fields with duplicate names will be somehow mapped to Custom field rather than the System field even if I choose the correct field during the import.&#xd;
&#xd;
I suspect there is a bug in the CSV Importer around the name of a custom field when selecting it for import, particularly if there is a standard field by the same name.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a custom field named "Status". Not a good idea, but that's what was done.&#xd;
 # Create a CSV file for import with Issue ID, reporter, summary, status columns.&#xd;
 # Use the CSV importer to import the CSV file, mapping as expected. Select the standard JIRA field Status for the status column.&#xd;
 # Note that the custom field named Status is selected since it is named as a custom field, not a standard field in the CSV Importer mapping.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The System field Status should have been updated.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Custom field Status have been updated.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
*Option 1 (Recommended)*&#xd;
 # Rename the Custom Field to a different name before the import.&#xd;
 # Perform the CSV import.&#xd;
 # Rename back the Custom field back to the original name.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Option 2*&#xd;
 # After mapping the fields for the import, the import wizard will give you the option to {_}Begin import{_}.&#xd;
 # At this page, click Back button on your web browser.&#xd;
 # Choose again the standard Status field again.</description><createDate>2021-07-08T19:58:56.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hello!&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Cascading custom field value ( Parent Value -> Child Value) is not imported correctly when using CSV import from ( Issues and filters > Three dots button > Imports Issues from CSV).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a multiple cascading custom field which have Parent Value and Child Value&#xd;
# Then, create CSV file to import the issue. For example :-&#xd;
 [^new_test.csv] &#xd;
# Then, import it from :-&#xd;
## Go to Issue and Filters page&#xd;
## Then , click the three dots button on the top right&#xd;
## Then, choose *Imports Issues from CSV*&#xd;
## Then, import the CSV file with mapped fields.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The custom field update correctly with parent value and child value.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Child value is not imported&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: no&#xd;
&#xd;
As per the documentation, the [*Get Jira instance info*|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-server-info/#api-rest-api-3-serverinfo-get] REST API endpoint (GET {{/rest/api/3/serverInfo}}) can be called anonymously. &#xd;
&#xd;
However, if you don't authenticated as a user that has access to the Jira site, the {{serverTime}} property is not returned (using an active Atlassian Account session that has no access to the site doesn’t work either, you need to use and account that has access to the site).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # As a user that has access to the Jira site, call https://SITENAME.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/serverInfo &#xd;
 # See that the {{serverTime}} property is present in the response&#xd;
 # Now, repeat the same test without providing any authentication&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The {{serverTime}} property is present in the response&#xd;

The {{serverTime}} property is not returned&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Bulk rest api calls that fails with DB connection errors is returning a 403 response code to the client.&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Content response is even more misleading :&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;html>&#xd;
&lt;head>&#xd;
    &lt;title>Forbidden (403)&lt;/title> &#xd;
&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;![endif]-->&#xd;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" >&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
2. Jira application logs indicates DB connection error from too many request within a short period of time.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
ERROR	com.atlassian.plugins.rest.common.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper	&#xd;
Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDataSourceException: &#xd;
Unable to establish a connection with the database. (PSQL_TOO_MANY_CONNECTIONS Exception already occurred in this workcontext, skipping next getConnection)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Jira is returning wrong response code along with error message. The external App sends API request to Jira and it failed. Jira returns 403 error while it can return 429 error. If the App receives 403, it will stop operation. If the App receives 429, it should retry sending request again.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Call REST APIs in continuous succession&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If the rate limit is hit, the status 429. Throttling limit state should be returned in headers like [here|https://developers.trello.com/docs/rate-limits]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
HTTP 403 response code returned with the following content&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;

&#xd;
I don't agree this should be a 429.  429 should client side exponential backoff, but unless there's an actual request rate limit, clients can't really know how they should act if they want to be well-behaved and avoid it. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is system behavior that, from the client perspective, is totally dependent on hidden variables and random.&#xd;
&#xd;
This exception should just return a 500.  500's should be safe to retry always.  (also assuming the request is atomic, idempotent, and clients use exponential backoff.</text><author>Eric Psalmond</author></comments><comments><text>We acknowledge existence of the problem with unexpected DB connection errors returned by API, and realize how painful it is for Ecosystem vendors, Jira and apps users. We’d love to deliver fix asap, but unfortunately it will take us at least few more months as solution requires major updates to our rate limiting mechanisms. Good news is that we work on that already.&#xd;
&#xd;
403 errors indicate Atlassian infrastructure is overloaded by the number of incoming requests, and in order to avoid Jira outage we rate limit some of them. Current rate limiting mechanism is implemented at Jira site level and is exposed to "noisy neighbourhood" issue. Requests coming from the users, your app and other apps accessing our infrastructure are treated in the same manner, so single misbehaving consumer can trigger rate limiting for the whole Jira site.&#xd;
&#xd;
We are actively working on per consumer rate limiting which should help us provide meaningful information in the response headers. We’ll let you when we have got more details.&#xd;
&#xd;
At the time being we suggest:&#xd;
- Retry failed requests using back-off mechanism to lower the frequency of retries. In other words - retry request responsibly, by giving Jira more time to recover if previous retry attempt failed.&#xd;
- Use [dynamic webhooks|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/#registering-a-webhook-via-the-rest-api--for-connect-apps-] to be notified about changes that happened in Jira.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result of changes announced in 2017 ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/02/add-on-permissions-update)] any changes around atlassian-addon-project-access role persist only until the first app installation or update and then they are overwritten.&#xd;
&#xd;
The possibility to remove atlassian-addons-project-access role from permission or issue security scheme gives admins a false impression they can restrict app access to some projects or features. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: no&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to *Permissions schemes*&#xd;
 # Pick one of them and click *Permissions*&#xd;
 # Remove `atlassian-addons-project-access` from some permission ie. Administer Projects or Manage sprints&#xd;
 # Install any app&#xd;
 # Check that the role was readded to that permission&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
As Atlassian intention was to have `atlassian-addons-project-access` always added to all permissions schemes and issue security schemes there should be no possibility to manage that project role access.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Admins have the impression they have limited apps access to some projects, however, their settings are overwritten on any app installation or update.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Admin can implement a side script that detects the reading of the project role happened and update schemes according to their initial requirements.</description><createDate>2023-08-03T11:39:27.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hello!&#xd;
In this [Atlassian Changelog|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/changelog/#CHANGE-1115] is an information about the withdrawal of the ability to manage the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role. Also there is information about:&#xd;
”{_}By default, the role is assigned to all project permissions in permission schemes and all issue security levels in issue security schemes. As a result of this change, the possibility to manage that role’s permissions and issue security levels, both via the UI and the REST API, will be restricted.”{_}&#xd;
I checked the creation of the issue security level in the Company managed project and at this point the role atlassian-addons-project-access *is not assigned by default to all issue security levels in issue security schemes. Once created, I have the option to add this role or not !* &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Sometimes we have such cases when clients when adding security level do not add atlassian-addons-project-access role therefore our application loses access to the issue. Therefore, after creating a request to us, we tell the client to add these roles to issue security. &#xd;
&#xd;
1) How will it work after the changes concerning this role? When a new security level is created by user, will the role *atlassian-addons-project-access* be added by default ( currently it is not added ) and the user will not be able to remove it?&#xd;
2) For project permissions, will the role *atlassian-addons-project-access* be defaulted to all existing permissions and the user will not be able to remove it?</text><author>Mikołaj Maruniak {Appfire}</author></comments><comments><text>hello [~50aed2dd2eab] thanks for reaching out to us!&#xd;
&#xd;
1 - after the changes for new security levels the role will be added by default (and the admin won't be able to remove it)&#xd;
&#xd;
2 - after the changes when new permission scheme is created it will have *atlassian-addons-project-access* added to all permissions and the admin won't be able to remove it.&#xd;

&#xd;
There is a huge concern with this issue. Amdocs Infosec people need a way to control App permissions in the project. We told them "no problem, you can control that using the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role, just remove that role from the permission scheme".&#xd;
&#xd;
Now we understand that this is not really working... and that it's going to be deprecated...&#xd;
&#xd;
This poses a huge security risk that Amdocs Infosec are not willing to accept. The customer (and I believe that all large customers of Atlassian) want some way to control project permissions given to 3rd party apps.&#xd;

 </text><author>Ran Lavi</author></comments><comments><text>hello [~90d124564953] &#xd;
Thank you for your feedback.&#xd;
Can You describe the use case in more detail - is it that the customer wants some apps present on their instance and at the same time they want to restrict access to some projects/issues?&#xd;
Mind that removal of *atlassian-addons-project-access* project role from the permission scheme does not fully protect forge apps from accessing the project issue data.&#xd;
It will cause eg. [product events|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/events-reference/product_events/] to be not delivered to the forge app - which is probably what you are aiming for.&#xd;
On the other hand, there can be UI components eg. a [background script|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/manifest-reference/modules/jira-issue-view-background-script/] that uses a [resolver|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/custom-ui-resolver/] and this resolver, in turn, uses *asUser()* to query for issue data and can send it to an arbitrary URL (or store it in forge storage and somehow expose it through eg. webtrigger) - this use case will need user consent (scopes and external URLs are displayed on the consent screen) but it’s doable and might be considered a security hole in your use case.&#xd;
Like You’ve mentioned a new set of restricting app access to specific entities is coming soon: [https://www.atlassian.com/wac/roadmap/cloud/app-data-access-controls?&amp;p=5c9cdc85-f8] and hopefully it will resolve your issues.&#xd;

&#xd;
Thank you for the detailed comment.&#xd;
&#xd;
The use case is very simple: many apps require Jira admin permissions and the customer is concerned that they might abuse this permission by mistake or if the servers of the vendor are compromised by an attacker.&#xd;
&#xd;
So the customer wants a way to restrict app permissions, for example remove ability of apps to delete issues, edit issues, etc. &#xd;
&#xd;
The new planned cloud feature really looks interesting. But the customer wants to migrate to the cloud in October and cannot wait for this feature, so a temporary workaround is needed. We thought that removing the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role from the project permission was a good workaround, but then we noticed this bug. &#xd;
&#xd;
Not having any workaround risks the migration to the cloud. so please don't fix this bug until the new cloud feature is implemented.</text><author>Ran Lavi</author></comments><comments><text>Hello, &#xd;
&#xd;
We are currently leveraging the ability to remove the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role from the "Delete All Comments" permission within our Jira Service Management project's permission scheme in an attempt to remediate unwanted Atlassian Assist functionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
Details on said issue: *any user* with access to a ticket thread within the Assist Slack App can delete comments from *any other user* (including agents) on the JSM ticket itself.&#xd;
 * The history of who deleted the comment within a thread is not presented&#xd;
 ** History simply states "Atlassian assist deleted a comment"&#xd;
 * No indication of what the comment said is retained&#xd;
 ** All history of the comment's content is seemingly lost&#xd;
&#xd;
Further conversation on this topic are captured in PCS-174430. Support was not able to offer an alternative solution at the time aside from advising that we request our users to not delete comments. We also were not made aware that the ability to manage the atlassian-addons-project-access role gives admins a false impression they can restrict app access to some projects or features. &#xd;
&#xd;
Please let me know what other workaround we can use, or if the bot's functionality can/will be changed to account for this concern.</text><author>svivanco</author></comments><comments><text>We're back to square one. We got more details on the new cloud feature for restricting app access ([link|[https://www.atlassian.com/wac/roadmap/cloud/app-data-access-controls?&amp;p=5c9cdc85-f8]).]&#xd;
&#xd;
It doesn't satisfy the need. It can only block the app for accessing an entire specific project. This is not what our customer is looking for. The need is to prevent apps from editing issues, deleting issues, etc.  &#xd;
&#xd;
So we really need the option to continue to control this via the permission scheme via the addition or removal of *atlassian-addons-project-access.* We understand that this is not working as expected and might give false impression. The question is what is the workaround? The infosec people from the customer are concerned that a compromised app will edit issues, and for that reason their are reluctant to approve cloud migration of a very large instance (total of 25k users).&#xd;
&#xd;
We really need a solution, and until there is no alternative, we need the workaround of manipulating the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role.</text><author>Ran Lavi</author></comments><comments><text>This isn't something that is good - we want to be able to manage the security of some projects, and if we cannot remove the addon, it will mean that users can potentially do any view / edit / delete actions from the addon via Automations.

Please reconsider the restrictions that are being added to this group.</text><author>Jennifer Luo</author></comments><comments><text>Just another failure to listen to customers on Atlassian's behalf. Are we really surprised? </text><author>William Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>I would like to reiterate my previous comment:&#xd;
&#xd;
Please do not fix this bug. It is VERY VERY important for our customers to be able to remove the *atlassian-addons-project-access* from the permission scheme. This allows the customer to control if apps are able (as example) to delete issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you fix this bug and do not allow to remove that role from the permission scheme, our customer will not have any way to restrict apps from deleting issues. This is important!&#xd;
&#xd;
Yes, we are aware that every app installation/update on the cloud will restore that role for all permission schemes. But this is something that we can handle. We are monitoring the app installation audit log (using SIEM system), and after every installation, we are updating the permission schemes (using API) and removing that role again.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is uglly, but necessary. Please DO NOT fix this bug unless there is a suitable alternative for restricting apps from deleting issues. Without this, the risk is that our customer (few Data Center instances with 25k users) will not approve migration to Cloud, as this is too large risk for him.</text><author>Ran Lavi</author></comments><comments><text>Better keep the ability to manage addon access in project perspective .... &#xd;

&#xd;
In large organizations, it is not unusual for different company divisions, with different security needs to share the same Jira instance.&#xd;

These enterprise instances may have one business unit which wants to use a third party app, and another which doesn't (or can't) due to tighter audit concerns.&#xd;
&#xd;
The existing mechanism allows for 'hiding' secure projects from 3rd parties in a way that can easily be demonstrated to auditors.&#xd;

If you remove the ability to manage this, then the result will be that many apps will simply have to be removed from the instance. &#xd;

Not being able to do so will result in much stricter requirements from our internal Privacy and Sourcing teams when assessing new data processors, making it a lot less likely we can onboard Jira apps&#xd;

*Atlassian Update – 9 April 2024*&#xd;
Hello everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
We appreciate your feedback and comments. Please be assured that we're diligently examining the use cases outlined in this ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
{color:#de350b}*At present, +we've decided not to proceed+ with the removal of this role until we have a deeper understanding.*{color}&#xd;
&#xd;
The upcoming [App Access Rule|https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/block-app-access/] functionality appears to be the ideal solution for some of the use cases mentioned. We're also investigating options for more refined app control.&#xd;
Kindly continue monitoring this ticket for further updates.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you.&#xd;

This is no doubt the result of some of us who have talked with the Atlassian team, and expressed our deepest concerns. We should have some movement on getting access to application logging sometime soon here as well. They are not as good as they should be about communication and listening yet... but I do believe they are working on it. </text><author>William Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>Well William, as long as they still write it in any of the weekly rollout previews, I am still expecting it to happen.&#xd;
&#xd;
So I saw that note in April, but they still say every week that they will do it, that's why I wanted to emphasize that this is still a major problem to customers. </text><author>Richard Scholtes</author></comments><comments><text>[~b9f8a477d4a5] - You make a good point. &#xd;
 &#xd;
... and I did say they were not as good about communicating as they could be. &#xd;
 &#xd;
The honest truth though... is that, as a company, they barely have visibility into their own work, and ZERO visibility on their community boards. These conversations are all just...  "us". And not "them". There's far too much traffic in these comments for them to track each one. &#xd;
&#xd;
I believe they are currently trying to hire more community experience folks. But small efforts are either the beginning of big efforts, or they are destined to fail.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Email Atlassian. Call them. You undoubtedly have a customer rep. Call that person, and make your concerns heard loud and clear. Then tell all your associates that work with the product to do the same.&#xd;
 &#xd;
It's *not* a lost effort. I believe that is how we (potentially) got a stop put to this issue. I have been polite and composed, but relentless. I've managed to have some very civil and productive conversations with management, and I'm speaking with them about the future of our spending with them. At present, they are well aware that I am entertaining other (future) options. The more of us being vocal about walking away, and not spending our money with them, the more invested they will be in what we are asking for. </text><author>William Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>How will this impact the migration of projects to other cloud sites?&#xd;
&#xd;
When i migrate a project to a new cloud, the permissions automatically add an 'atlassian-addon-project-access (MIGRATED)' permission to the project roles and I have to add the 'atlassian-addon-project-access' project role to each permission to ensure my 3rd party apps work (e.g. revyz backups, etc)&#xd;
&#xd;
Please let me know impact of migrated project permissions. &#xd;

&#xd;
Removing this is a deal breaker for any of your customers with strict audit requirements. This is particular true for:&#xd;
 * Delete Issue Permission&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed solution via a Data Privacy Policy is not enough. While needed because not all App Vendors have Data Residency setup, this is not a replacement for the functionality to explicitly prohibit a 3rd Party App to delete issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
Best regards!</text><author>Andreas Krupp</author></comments><comments><text>It is truly surprising that Atlassian claims compliance with GDPR and DORA while permitting vendors to configure setups outside of data residency requirements, such as outside the EU.&#xd;
&#xd;
Moreover, when we are compelled to utilize certain functionalities—features that should ideally be available out of the box—vendors often demand extensive permissions for our instances. This creates significant security and compliance challenges during audits.&#xd;
&#xd;
Rather than concentrating on "Pokémon look-alike icons," we urge Atlassian to prioritize resolving these pressing issues.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Scenario:&#xd;
 * Create a Jira Issue using REST API Version 2&#xd;
 * Use a specific combination of words (be mindful of the two blank spaces below):&#xd;
 ** text(!!) text&#xd;
 ** text!text?!  more text!&#xd;
 ** text?!  more text!!&#xd;
 ** text?!  more text! !&#xd;
 ** Or variations&#xd;
&#xd;
This causes Jira Cloud to try and render an image (which is not present in the description body) - resulting in a _Preview unavailable_ error:&#xd;
!image-2023-07-14-11-57-57-930.png|width=575,height=244!&#xd;
&#xd;
This also results in data loss - part of the text (between the second and last exclamation marks are lost - as Jira tries to render them as an image).&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Jira Issue via REST API calls, using the [API's Version 2|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-2-issue-post]&#xd;
 # Add a text to the Issue (description) that has that combination of words: _text(!!) text, text!_ or variations&#xd;
 # Check the Issue on your Jira Cloud site&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
A Jira Issue rendering the description text correctly.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
A Jira Issue trying to render an image where there isn't one.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the [Jira Cloud REST API Version 3|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-post]&#xd;
Additional reference: [Document builder|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/playground/]</description><createDate>2023-07-14T15:10:47.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We're also experiencing this issue after migrating Jira Server to Jira Cloud. There are several Jira-issues where specific combination of words were replaced by a 'Preview unavailable' tile. &#xd;
&#xd;
In our case, the following text patterns were replaced:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
!) some text!{noformat}&#xd;
What's quite interesting, is that all text between the exclamation marks can be found in the data-id attribute of the 'preview unavailable' div's child-element.&#xd;
&#xd;
Unfortunately, we couldn't find a workaround to recover the information from the data-id element to the wysiwyg-editor.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When the Assignee field is not included on the Edit screen for a given Issue Type, if you attempt to set the assignee for that issue via the API endpoint "/rest/api/3/issue/EX-1234", it will fail to update the issue. However, the API will still return a 204 success response, making it unclear whether there was a problem or not.&#xd;
&#xd;
According to [the API documentation for this endpoint|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-put-response], the response should be a 400 indicating the field is not able to be edited.&#xd;
{quote}400 Bad Request&#xd;
&#xd;
Returned if:&#xd;
 - the request body is missing.&#xd;
 - the user does not have the necessary permission to edit one or more fields.&#xd;
 - *+the request includes one or more fields that are not found or are not associated with the issue's edit screen.+*&#xd;
 - the request includes an invalid transition.{quote}&#xd;
This has been tested with various other system and custom fields, and all returned the expected 400 error if the field was absent from the Edit screen. This behavior has only been reproducible with the "Assignee" field.&#xd;
----&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: unknown&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Remove "Assignee" field from the "Edit" screen on an issue type&#xd;
 # Send the following payload to an issue using the same issue type:&#xd;
{code:json}&#xd;
"fields":{&#xd;
	"assignee": {&#xd;
		"id": "USER_ID_HERE"&#xd;
		}&#xd;
	}&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Error 400 returned with message "Field 'assignee' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown."&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Success 204 returned with empty response.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensuring the Assignee field is present on the Edit screen of the issue type before submitting the API call should allow the request to actually succeed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Alternatively, there is a dedicated endpoint for assigning issues., which will allow updating the assignee of the issue irrespective of the field's presence on the Edit screen. Documentation for this endpoint &#xd;
[https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-assignee-put]&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, you would submit the following payload to the endpoint {{[https://your-site.atlassian.net//rest/api/3/issue/EX-1234/assignee]}}&#xd;
{code:json}&#xd;
{ "accountId": "USER_ID_HERE" }&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
If we create a custom field of type "Message Custom Field (for edit)" and add a context to it with multiple projects. Then, if we set a default value in the context, the GUI will keep showing the default value that's set in the default context.&#xd;
The issue is in the GUI. The actual value that's been set is still used in the screens.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# create a custom field of type Message Custom Field (for edit) and set a default value in it’s global context.&#xd;
# Create a second context for the custom field&#xd;
# Add multiple projects in the second context (has to be more than one).&#xd;
# The add a default value in the new context and click Set Default button.&#xd;
# Now, if we go back to Edit the default value, the input box will be pre-filled with the value we set in the Default context.&#xd;
# However, the actual value is still the one we had set. If we check the created issue screen, we can see the value we’ve set.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Additional context shows the correct default value that's been set to the custom field.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Additional context shows the default value that's been set in the default context.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Instead of selecting multiple projects in the context, select one project. And, create multiple contexts for each project.</description><createDate>2023-05-30T00:25:39.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Thanks to Nashid to escalate this issue found by my team. We need to show messages for various transition screens from different workflows / projects / issue types. Each with a different message to warn the users which fields are required. As we already have a large set of projects, the messages are various.&#xd;
&#xd;
As for now, due to the problem showing the correct default value of each context (when multiple projects are selected), we cannot use the contextual solution because that makes editing / changing the default value impossible. We adopted a work-around by adding / using a new message for for each of such transition, no context involved. Although it gets the job done, the large amount of message fields is beginning to also cause maintenance headaches.&#xd;
&#xd;
Nashid suggested to use the approach that each context should have only one project. It works, but the problem is sometimes the same message is shared among several projects (and that's why we originally used the multiple-projects-in-one-context solution which had the UI problem). So this approach is still somehow "bloated"... Other than message fields are bloated, now the contexts are bloated, so it's still not ideal.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thus, my team would hope that your DEV team can fix this issue on Jira's maintenance page of message field which can greatly make our work easier, thank you!</text><author>Tony Chu</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Sandbox Notifications show up under Bell-icon in Production sites.</summary><key>JRACLOUD-81129</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-81129</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

*NOTE:* This bug report is for {*}JIRA Cloud{*}. Using {*}JIRA Server{*}? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-31720].&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Summary&#xd;
 # This bug is related to closed bug ticket https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-31720&#xd;
 # When the Current Assignee is given the Browse Project Permission, other users are able to view this Project.&#xd;
 # They can't necessarily view issues or create issues, but they can see the project from the *View All Projects* page.&#xd;
 # They are also able to see the project name at the project filter on the Issue Search navigator but no issues will be displayed. Only the name of the filter at Projects. When trying to search issues from restricted projects it will show "No issues were found to match your search" which is good.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. ensure to have a Jira instance with several projects e.g 'Project A' and 'Project B' - Done&#xd;
2. ensure to have at least two different permission schemes e.g. 'Permission Scheme A' and 'Permission Scheme B' - Done&#xd;
3. ensure to that e.g. 'Project A' uses the 'Permission Scheme A' and 'Project B' uses the 'Permission Scheme B' - Done&#xd;
&#xd;
4. ensure that the 'Browse Project' permission is restricted to the appropriate project roles in each permission scheme e.g. to the project role 'Tester' -Done&#xd;
5. ensure that e.g. 'User A' is assigned as 'Tester' to 'Project A' only, while 'User B' is assigned as 'Tester' to 'Project B' - Done&#xd;
&#xd;
6. Add the Current Assignee permission to the Permission scheme A&#xd;
h3. Expected Results:&#xd;
&#xd;
User A is not supposed to be able to see Project B at all.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results:&#xd;
&#xd;
User B will see Project A even though doesn't have permission for it.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Remove Current Assignee on Browse Projects Permission&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround to restrict issue view to 'Current Assignee' and Browse Project to only a specific group of users:*&#xd;
If a Project is only relevant to one or several groups&#xd;
 # Add the related groups to the Role(Users) or Role(Developers) and remove unrelated groups that shouldn't see the project.&#xd;
 # Set Browse permissions for the Roles. (Remove 'Current Assignee' from Browse Project permission)&#xd;
 # Use Issue level security to restrict viewing to 'Current Assignee'&#xd;
*Result:* only groups and users in the Roles within Browse Project permission see the project and Browse only issues Assigned to them.&#xd;
Step by step instructions to set Security Level at [How to limit user to only browse issues assigned to or reported by them|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CLOUDKB/How+to+limit+user+to+only+browse+issues+assigned+to+or+reported+by+them]&#xd;

If a user *without admin role* in a project tries to add someone to the user, there is a misleading message stating:&#xd;
{quote}Project roles aren't editable on the Free plan. Upgrade for advanced team configuration.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
It seems that for Confluence and JIRA global permissions, it is shown up in the list as one of the groups.&#xd;
It should be a hidden group for trusted-users in the site administration page.&#xd;
Currently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
For Jira:&#xd;
# Login to Jira, and go to Global permissions&#xd;
&#xd;
For Confluence :&#xd;
# Login to Confluence, go to Global permissions&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
No trusted users group&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Trusted user groups shows as part of the list&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
We expect the trusted group to be a system group and should be hidden from the list.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When the *Affects versions* and *Fix versions* fields are updated such that there are multiple entries added or removed, the issue history entries do not capture the correct values that are present in the field. The history entry is updated with 'None -> XXXX' or 'XXXX -> None' which is misleading and confusing for the user.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Jira Software project&#xd;
 # Create two different versions. For e.g.; 1.0 and 1.1&#xd;
 # Create a ticket and update the *Affects versions* field with 1.0&#xd;
 ** The history entry shows *None -> 1.0* (which is correct)&#xd;
 # Update the *Affects versions* field with 1.1 (now, the field contains 1.0 and 1.1)&#xd;
 ** The history entry shows *None -> 1.1* (which is incorrect because the field was not empty. It should ideally show 1.0 and 1.1)&#xd;
 # Remove the version 1.0 from the *Affects versions* field so that only 1.1 is present&#xd;
 ** The history entry shows *1.0 -> None* (which is incorrect because 1.1 is still present)&#xd;
 # Remove the version 1.1 from the *Affects versions* field so that the field is now empty&#xd;
 ** The history entry shows *1.1 -> None* (which is correct because the field is now empty)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue history entries should still show the remaining values that are present in the *Affects versions* or *Fix versions* field instead of showing 'None'&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue history entries do not capture the existing values of the *Affects versions* or *Fix versions* field.&#xd;
&#xd;
The REST API changelog endpoint also does not capture the remaining values in the fields.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
When you edit the link name of "Cloners", the default clone link, if you try to clone an issue the link between the original issue and the cloned one won't be created, but the Cloned issue will.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Go to Cog > Issues > Issue linking&#xd;
# Click on Edit near to *Cloners* and change it to +Clone+ (for example)&#xd;
# Click on Save&#xd;
# Try to clone any issue&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
A clone issue should be created with a link to the original issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
A clone issue is created but the link between both Jira issues isn't generated.&#xd;
&#xd;
If editing the original link breaks the link creation while cloning an issue, it shouldn't be possible to edit the original config. This may also affect apps, such as [Zephyr Scale - Test Management for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213259/zephyr-scale-test-management-for-jira?tab=overview&amp;hosting=cloud].&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue collector ignores the default value set for a custom field in Jira.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a custom field, for example: 'First Answer'&#xd;
 # Set the default value for the field 'First Answer'&#xd;
 # Remove the field 'First Answer' from create-issue screen for the issuetype used to set the issue collector&#xd;
 # Mark the field mandatory via field configuration associated with the project.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue collector should consider the default value set for the field 'First Answer' and successfully create the issue for the given feedback.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue collector ignores the default value set for the field 'First Answer' rather than considering the field is mandatory &amp; missing from create screen. &#xd;
This happens because the issue collector search for all the fields for the selected issuetype. There is a warning appears under 'Embedding this issue collector'&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The possible workaround is to add the required field on the create-issue screen or create a separate field configuration without marking 'First Answer' required.</description><createDate>2023-01-11T23:22:32.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Using middle click to open a linked issue in the new issue view duplicates opened link in Firefox</summary><key>JRACLOUD-80141</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-80141</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Using the middle click of a mouse in Firefox browsers can be configured in order to automatically open that link to a new tab. about:config setting&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick	true &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
However when you then use the middle click to open an issue link in the new issue view, you get 2 tabs instead of 1. Both tabs load that linked issue, but this is redundant and should not be happening.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you have&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick	false&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
set, then using the middle click on an issue link is still able to open the link in a new tab. In that case that behavior is not expected to happen.&#xd;
&#xd;
However everywhere else within the new issue view appears to honor this middleclick setting as expected.  It only appears that the issue link has a buggy behavior here.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 * New issue view&#xd;
 * Firefox&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create an issue using the new issue view&#xd;
 # Link that issue to some other issue in the same Jira site&#xd;
 # use the middle click of your mouse to click that issue link&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 # IF browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = true &#xd;
Then&#xd;
We expect that linked issue will be opened in a single new tab&#xd;
 # IF browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = false&#xd;
We expect nothing to happen as this should not open links&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 # IF browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = true &#xd;
Then&#xd;
We get 2 tabs with that issue link instead of one.&#xd;
 # IF browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = false&#xd;
a new link is still opened once when it shouldn't be opened at all.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
Only appears to affect Firefox so far in testing, Chrome does not do this, and safari has been inconsistent in results.&#xd;

&#xd;
After disabling the *Product Recommendations* in the *System* settings, products are still being recommended for the users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Turning off the Product recommendation from the link [https://admin.atlassian.com/s/&lt;site-id>/billing/addapplication?requestproductoptout=false|https://admin.atlassian.com/s/a7d30d89-fe73-43e9-91b7-62798d670e02/billing/addapplication?requestproductoptout=false] also does not work.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Jira Settings > System > General Configuration&#xd;
 # The Product Recommendation is OFF with no way to edit it.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
With the setting disabled, we expect that no in-product recommendations in Jira Cloud will appear for admins and end-users.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, regardless of the setting disabled, customers can still see in-product recommendations, more specifically for the below products:&#xd;
 * Compass&#xd;
 * Jira Service Management&#xd;
 * Atlas&#xd;
 * Jira Product Discovery&#xd;
&#xd;
Aside from the in-product recommendations, under Apps, end users can still request for apps and can see the option "Recommended for your Team"&#xd;
As a side-effect, this is resulting in Admins receiving unwanted product requests from end users.&#xd;

Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;

 * End users are usually the least informed party regarding business decisions, so should not be prompted to initiate business decisions (i.e. get the cool new toy)&#xd;
 * An organisation adopting a product feature is a significantly more complex process than simply being aware of a feature's existence&#xd;
 * Administrators are the only audience who should _ever_ see product recommendations (and this should be {*}opt-in{*})&#xd;
&#xd;
+*Disabling a feature must disable it completely and permanently*+&#xd;
&#xd;
This should be self-explanatory, but in case it's not here are some excerpts from the [dictionary.com definition of the word "off"|https://www.dictionary.com/browse/off] (as in "turn it off"):&#xd;
{quote}adverb&#xd;
1. so as to be no longer supported or attached:&#xd;
    _This button is about to come off._&#xd;
9. out of operation or effective existence:&#xd;
    _Turn the lights off._&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
 &#xd;
{quote}preposition&#xd;
20. so as no longer to be supported by, attached to, on, resting on, or unified with:&#xd;
    _Take your feet off the table!_&#xd;
    _Break a piece of bread off the loaf._&#xd;

&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
please have this bug fixed as soon as possible. Our own employees and our clients are frustrated by any form of ads in a paid software. This is the worst idea for professional software we have ever seen.&#xd;
&#xd;
We understand that people are proud of stuff they build and that they want them to be used. But right now, being on a standard plan feels like a magazine with more ads than articles or a webpage financed through advertising.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is just unprofessional and should this stuff continue people are considering moving to different products from more professional vendors.&#xd;
&#xd;
To set the scope of ads I am talking about:&#xd;
 * Confluence&#xd;
 ** Functions in premium plan (e.g. calendars or automation) in the sidebar (some can be turned off, but this needs to be done space by space, frustrating work for admins)&#xd;
 ** Products in the search bar (e.g. compass or AI)&#xd;
 ** Additional Apps in the app menu&#xd;
 ** Space permission page (for premium plan)&#xd;
 * Jira&#xd;
 ** Products in the search bar (e.g. compass or AI)&#xd;
 ** Additional Apps in the app menu&#xd;
 ** Plans &amp; Assets in the main menu bar (stuff only available in premium plan)&#xd;
 ** Compass in components page&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you for your understanding!</text><author>Sebastian Albrecht</author></comments><comments><text>As much as Atlassian Product and Engineering may frustrate me at times, _Support_ is almost uniformly lovely and has been able to at least shed some light here. Specifically:&#xd;
 * The opt-out functionality that does exist is indeed bugged.&#xd;
 * There are ads and ad units which can either "opt-out of the opt-out", or are not included in its scope in the first place...so even when this bug is fixed, it's not going to allow us to actually "turn of the ads", just some sub-set.&#xd;
 * None of this currently, or apparently will, touch the more "native advertising" like the AI buttons embedded all over the place.&#xd;
 * Atlassian seems to be treating every type of ad and feature team doing it as unique and independent, so as of now it doesn't seem like there's going to _be_ a way to disable this whole-hog.&#xd;
&#xd;
I encourage anyone interested in this to put in Support tickets and use the "Send Feedback" options liberally to express your thoughts and feelings. I can't say it pays a _lot_ of attention, but the Eye of Atlassauron does at least occasionally peek at these.&#xd;
&#xd;
Maybe.&#xd;
&#xd;
The OTHER thing Support can do for you is opt people out of these on a per-user basis. We are running a test with it right now as it seems to be new\unstable functionality, but so far no issues and more importantly NO ADVERTISING IN A PRODUCT WE PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO USE. If we are able to apply this instance-wide with no issues, I'll update here to confirm.</text><author>Haddon Fisher</author></comments><comments><text>Hundreds of thousands of dollars in spend and the button to turn off advertising doesn't work?

&#xd;
Are you genuinely having difficulty understanding the issue here and how to resolve it? I think that your question is a perfect example of the problem: A company of people who don't possess reading comprehension or critical thinking skills. Or perhaps you simply do not use your own products? &#xd;
&#xd;
"As an admin, would you expect recommendations to be turned off for all users, or just at the user level?" What does this even mean???&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Just blanket, across the board, turn that shit off. No one asked for it. As an admin I don't want popups or tool tips advertising in the system, and I certainly don't want it for my users. We know exactly what you are doing: You want to advertise new toys to our users, so that they ask for them and we end up spending more time and money fulfilling their whims. It's like direct advertising to consumers prescription medications - stop it. The users don't know what they want.&#xd;
&#xd;
Stop waffling. Stop stalling.

 * "As an admin, I should be able to disable this in all places for all users in a single click" is the most baseline need. The majority of people will want to achieve that end-state, so making them go through hoops like assigning this via groups or other methods is pointlessly burdensome.&#xd;
 * "As an admin, I should be able to disable this in all places for all non-site admin users and site admins independently" feels like a nice-to-have, because if there was a __ group who would want these kinds of notifications it would be the site admins. Again, I don't think there is a purpose in tying "all non-site admins" to groups for the same reason as above, but I could potentially see some site admins choosing to receive these ads instead of other types of notifications about new Atlassian products.

&#xd;
When customers follow the process to reset [JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/reset-and-delete-all-data-from-your-cloud-site-691012037.html] by deactivating and re-activating its subscription the global permissions are not restored correctly.&#xd;

This causes issues as the customer won't be able to search for users and groups within the application.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make sure you have Confluence and JIRA at your instance.&#xd;
 # Follow the reset process outlined [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/reset-and-delete-all-data-from-your-cloud-site-691012037.html].&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a customer is performing a bulk operation to another project using the "Move" action, sometimes non-required fields are shown as required.&#xd;
&#xd;
Also, some fields like Description will be cleared of any value, ticking 'Retain' does not help and the field is cleared of any entries once the bulk move is completed.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * text and radio button fields are reported as required during the bulk move from a team managed project -> company managed project even when these fields are not associated with the project screen. Backend condition that is buggy in behavior is notAllInScope i.e custom field is not in the scope of ANY issue context.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;

Populated fields like descriptions should retain their value.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Non-required fields showing as required.&#xd;
Populated fields like Description are cleared once the move is completed.&#xd;
This also applies to all other custom fields using the "Text Field (multi-line)" type&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
This typically happens if the destination Project is using a different Field Configuration and the field renderer doesn't match (Default Text Renderer vs Wiki Style Renderer).

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There are some possible workarounds to get the correct value:&#xd;
* The endpoint [Get issue worklogs|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-worklogs/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-worklog-get] returns the field *started*, which is the field that contains the date entered in the log work rather than the date from when the entry was created&#xd;
* The [endpoint to perform advanced searches|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-search/#api-rest-api-3-search-get] is able to return the worklog field, and it will contain the *started* value as well&#xd;
** E.g. /rest/api/3/search?jql=filter=10014&amp;fields=key,worklog&#xd;
* Our [integration with Google Sheets|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220382/jira-cloud-for-google-sheets-official?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview] or [Jira Cloud for Excel|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221301/jira-cloud-for-excel-official?tab=overview&amp;hosting=cloud] offer the option to export the *started* value as well. Although if you need the worklogs in order to import values into a Jira instance it would require some manual work to merge the cells correctly:&#xd;

When a user logs work for a date that is different from the date when the log entry was added, the CSV export uses the date the log entry was added, not the date the work was done on.

As a result, the export cannot be used for external time reporting as the work shows up being done on the wrong date.  For example, if a developer logs all of their time first thing Monday morning for all of the work for the prior week, all of the work shows as being done on the Monday, not for the previous week.  This leads to curious issues where a developer shows they worked 37.5 hours on one day.  Trippy.

Issue Summary&#xd;
Jira Cloud API Audit record ({{GET /rest/api/3/auditing/record}}) is returning Jira usernames instead of Atlassian Account Ids making it harder for administrators to see who made an action.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make a request to get audit records from Jira using the [GET /rest/api/3/auditing/record|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-audit-records/#api-rest-api-3-auditing-record-get] REST API endpoint&#xd;
 # See the response&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The response returned allows you to identify (complying with GDPR guidelines) the user who made the action that was logged.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The returned results identifies the user by their Jira username which does not follow the standards described here: [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/]&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, the only way to clear the value of date time picker fields is by clicking on the field value, clicking on the "X" that appears on the right-hand side, then clicking on the field area again and clicking outside the field area.&#xd;
&#xd;
Here's a short video showing how it works: [https://www.loom.com/share/5191b049fd4e45ecab68c2ba96301775?sid=482b7409-4c6c-4327-bea6-64500e3a8aed] &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Enter a field value in Date and Time picker field.&#xd;
 # Click Enter for the value to be saved.&#xd;
 # Click on the field again > click on the X to clear the entire field.&#xd;
 # Click enter or elsewhere on the issue.&#xd;
 # The field gets stuck on prompt values.&#xd;

6. Refreshing the page returns the old value we put in p.1&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking the X should clear the field immediately after clicking enter or elsewhere on the issue. The same way it is behaving for a Date fields.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Refreshing the page returns the old Date and Time value. The 'X' button does not reflect immediately with 1 click.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To clear the field click on the 'X', then again on the field and then outside. This additional click inside the field clears it out once we go out of the field.&#xd;

&#xd;
If you don't click inside the field area after clicking on the "X", the change will not be saved.&#xd;
h3. Suggestion&#xd;
&#xd;
Improve this experience in a way that clicking on the "X" clears the value and saves the change.</description><createDate>2021-09-02T19:46:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I'd like to request that this be reclassified as a Bug/Defect, because it does not match the functionality that users get when using the Date Picker, and has been very frustrating for many of our users.</text><author>Nick Daniel</author></comments><comments><text>I contacted the support and got this link as response. For us it is not the same behavior:&#xd;
&#xd;
When clicking the X at the Time Picker there is a "freeze" of our Cloud Jira and no clicking anywhere is possible. You need to refresh the website.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking on the following actions on a Jira issue from the filter statistics gadget in the new dashboard UI does not return any action.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the new dashboard UI, create a filter statistics gadget and choose a filter&#xd;
 # Save the gadget&#xd;
 # Hovering the mouse pointer over an issue displayed in the gadget, on the right side you will see a "..." icon, open it and from the, you will see several actions, try to perform any of the affected actions below, like Log work.&#xd;
 # The action will work as expected, then go back to the dashboard (as you will likely be taken to another page to perform the action from the previous step), and attempt to perform any of the affected actions, on any ticket displayed in the same gadget.&#xd;
&#xd;
(!)  Known affected actions are:&#xd;
 * -Assign- &lt; now works correctly&#xd;
 * -Assign to me- &lt; now works correctly&#xd;
 * -Comment- &lt; now works correctly&#xd;
 * Log work&#xd;
 * -Voters- &lt; now works correctly&#xd;
 * Watch issue&#xd;
 * Link&#xd;
 * Clone&#xd;
 * Labels&#xd;
 * Delete&#xd;
 ** Actions not listed here work as expected, consistently.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The action works as expected.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Selections are unresponsive and do not cause any change or action, for the affected actions. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
* Refresh the page manually&#xd;
* Once any of the working actions are used, this usually also leads to a page refresh, which "resets" the stuck status of the affected actions and they can be used one more time. &#xd;
* For the Log work action using a different Time tracking provider like Tempo Timesheets overrides the default Jira functionality, and is not affected by this bug.</description><createDate>2021-06-10T12:16:25.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I believe this bug was originally raised with a different scenario than the one we currently have at JRACLOUD-83258&#xd;

In the original scenario (here), it only states that the functions don't work at all, while in the current scenario, most of them work, and some of them work once, and after that it requires a page refresh for them to work again.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In the new issue view, in the issue description or in a multi-line text custom field, if you add a URL that is not {*}http{*}, {*}https{*}, *ftp* or {*}mailto{*}, this is not rendered as a link but it is shown as single text:&#xd;
!01-Links-multi-line-text.jpg|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Everything works fine when using a single-line text field.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the new issue view, in an issue description enter a valid URL like, for example [ftp://something.org|ftp://something.org/]&#xd;
 # See that after hitting enter, the string is correctly rendered as a link&#xd;
 # Now repeat the same test but enter any of the following URLs: [ftps://something.com] or gopher://something.org or integrity://something.org or smb://, [file://|file:///] etc, and hit enter.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All the URLs are correctly rendered as links &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The URLs are rendered as simple text strings and are not clickable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Some URLs appear to be hyperlinks but nothing happens when you click them. When you try to open in a new tab [file://|file:///] they redirect to about:blank#blocked&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
In some cases, for the most used protocols like ftps:// and SCP, using the markdown syntax '[TEXT-HERE] (URL-HERE)' for links works:&#xd;
!02-markdown-workaround-ok.jpg|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
However, by using the markdown syntax using less common protocols like for example gopher:// or integrity:// or [nntp://], the text is rendered as a link, but it is creating a broken link that is missing the URL:&#xd;
!03-markdown-not-ok.jpg|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Another workaround, when applicable, is to use a single-line text field since everything is correctly rendered as a link in there.</description><createDate>2021-06-09T14:06:27.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Being able to manage a list of supported protocols would be great.</text><author>Jörn Reimerdes</author></comments><comments><text>What's the long term policy of Atlassian - to support custom links schemes or to forbid them?&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The REST API endpoints for getting project roles ([/rest/api/3/role|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-project-roles/#api-rest-api-3-role-get] and [/rest/api/3/role/\{id}|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-project-roles/#api-rest-api-3-role-id-get])  don’t return the scope for deleted Team-managed projects that are in Trash.&#xd;
&#xd;
This makes it impossible to distinguish if a Project role belongs to a Company or a Team project and can later lead to errors when invoking other Jira APIs with such project roles (e.g. trying to create a permission scheme with a grant to such role with the [API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-permission-schemes/#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-post] returns {{{}400 - Bad Request{}}}, with error: “Please select a valid project role”)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Next-Gen project and call one of the REST API endpoints to get project roles. See that project role scopes are returned in the response payload:  !When NG is deleted.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
# Move the Next-gen project to the trash&#xd;
# Call the same REST API endpoint(s) again&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The APIs should either return the roles with scope or don’t return them at all (for the Next-gen projects in the trash).&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The APIs return the project roles without scope, making them indistinguishable from roles for Company-managed projects.&#xd;

Hi everyone,

Thank you for previously raising this bug and bringing it to our attention.

Within our company roadmap and work capacity, we try to address or review each bug request but admit that not each one will be resolved. To continue the culture of being honest and open, we are closing this bug to focus on our upcoming roadmap for all Jira users.

As we continue to roll out features we do look at requests made by our users and if you feel like this bug is still impacting your team please let us know.

Thank you again for providing valuable feedback to our team!

&#xd;
This bug recently impacted my team. I was writing a script that needed access to the *atlassian-addons-project-access* role and when I ran the API to get all roles, I got multiple atlassian-addons-project-access roles with different IDs which made it difficult to determine which role was the right one. Had to end up hardcoding the ID of the main atlassian-addons-project-access role.&#xd;

Maham Nazir</text><author>Maham Nazir</author></comments><comments><text>Hey,&#xd;
This bug influences us and our customers.&#xd;
With this bug it is impossible to determine from the API which role is the active one and which role (or roles) are part of the trash object.&#xd;
We use only the API to interact with Jira, and we have no way to know to which project is related. Also, some customers do not want to delete the trashed project.&#xd;
The scope of the bug is bigger. You also get the permission scheme, notification scheme, and issue security scheme of the deleted team-managed project from the respective API calls.&#xd;
Those elements should be marked as trashed by the API in our opinion, it makes the data accessible through it incomplete&#xd;

&#xd;
This bug recently impacted our team. We are currently in the midst of transitioning our users from Azure DevOps to Jira. We are in the cloud and we created initial project configurations in our Sandbox and using AppFire's Configuration Manager for Jira Cloud (CMJ) our first 'deploy' from Sandbox to Production munged the resulting Production Project's Permissions. &#xd;
&#xd;
AppFire requested we permanently delete all Projects that were sitting in the trash. When we did so and re-deployed the issue was resolved.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
However, this manual step introduces a burden in that for every deployment we will need to verify whether there is any items in the trash that could cause this interruption again.&#xd;

This would really be helpful for us as we are summing up story points from child issues and therefore don't want this field to be editable on Epic level. Thanks!</text><author>Cornelia Jeppsson</author></comments><comments><text>My company is trying to better utilize automation to aggregate story points up from Stories, Technical Stories and Bugs up to the Epic level.  We would then aggregate the Epic story points up to the Initiative level which with a combination of using Jira Plans we would be able to easily see how many story points remain on Epics and Initiatives.  We do not want to allow manipulation of Story Points at the Epic and Initiative level and until this is fixed, the Story Point field is still editable even though it is not on the Epic and Initiative Create and Edit screens.  This was closed once before and I actually found an older Youtube video that showed this actually working so this is truly a feature that was working before but is now broken.  This is not a new feature, but in fact a bug.  Please fix this as this can be a valuable tool for evaluating remaining work at the Epic and Initiative level and have more trust in Plans. </text><author>randy.bergeron</author></comments><comments><text>This is a major BUG!!!!</text><author>Inbar Shtibel Levi</author></comments><comments><text>This is a Critical bug. </text><author>Sai Nikhil Guntur</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Sensitive data exposure via /secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa endpoint - CVE-2020-14179</summary><key>JRACLOUD-75661</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-75661</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
Jira Cloud allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to view custom field names and custom SLA names via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the /secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa endpoint.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Access the Jira Cloud URL: https://hostname.atlassian.net/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa as anonymous user without logging in.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The endpoint should not expose custom field names etc.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
It shows custom field names and custom SLA names.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Update&#xd;
&#xd;
We have tested this issue in Jira Cloud and have found that the issue described in the ticket is not reproducible. If an unauthorised user tries to access the URL, the user can see default Jira fields - that are the same for any instance, not custom fields. Thus no sensitive information gets exposed &amp; we have closed this ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
I am product manager working on Jira Cloud. We have investigated the current behaviour and we can confirm that the issue described in the ticket has been addressed and is no longer reproducible. &#xd;
&#xd;
If an unauthorised user tries to access the URL, he can see default Jira fields - that are publicly available and are the same for any Jira instance, not custom fields created specifically in a given instance. Thus the information that gets exposed is not of sensitive or confidential nature. &#xd;
&#xd;
With that we are closing this ticket as the issue described above had been resolved.</text><author>Yerbol Nisanbayev</author></comments><comments><text>OK &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
For multi-cascade fields the cascadeOption("Parent","child") works fine, the the ("Parent",none) also works fine. Except when you combine both.&#xd;
&#xd;
The JQL won't work even if the search is combined with other JQL search clause. &#xd;
&#xd;
Also, this bug is impacting customers if the filter gadget is used with grouping by the Cascading field.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Multi-Cascade Field.&#xd;
 # Search using the next JQL that works fine&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
"CascadeField[Select List (cascading)]" in cascadeOption("Option1","Option1A"))&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Search using the next JQL that works fine&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
"CascadeField[Select List (cascading)]" in cascadeOption("Option1",none))&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Combine both JQLs, it fails&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
"CascadeField[Select List (cascading)]" in cascadeOption("Option1",none)) OR "CascadeField[Select List (cascading)]" in cascadeOption("Option1","Option1A"))&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
# Combine with usual JQL search clause&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
"CascadeField[Select List (cascading)]" in cascadeOption("Option1",none) and project = ABC {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
JQL should return the combination of the individual results&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
the CascadeOption("Option1",none) breaks the results.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
No workaround.</description><createDate>2020-11-09T16:54:14.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - May 22, 2022|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
A negative value in a custom number field will be shown as zero in the issue history.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Add a custom number field to an issue in a Jira Software or Service Desk project.&#xd;
 # Put a positive number and a negative number here.&#xd;
 # Check the issue history. The negative number will be always be shown as 0.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
There are various *padding-right* and *padding-left* margins in the CSS layout throughout the new issue view, that cause excess whitespace on standard monitor layouts and does not allow the user to utilize the scaling options that are integrated into the code, the scaling gets worse on wider aspect ratio monitors as well as zooming out, in the browser zoom settings, beyond 100%.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# enable New issue view&#xd;
# Look at any issue from a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The margin paddings scale to meet at the very minimum the industry-standard 16:9 aspect ratio 1080p monitor sizes, but 100% scaling prefered for custom monitor solutions or users that prefer to zoom out for extended screen real-estate&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
As an Example, I am Looking at:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;div class="sc-iupvsZ chWGEj">&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
there is a padding set to scale to 100% but also restricted to a maximum of 1400px:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
padding-right: max((100% - 1400px) / 2, 0px);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Looks like this:&#xd;
!Screen Shot 2020-10-15 at 2.47.58 PM.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Because of this setting on an industry-standard 16:9 aspect ratio 1080p monitor, there is already an excessive amount of whitespace of 279px for the margin at padding-right (noting padding-left adds an additional 279px of whitespace), and would require scaling up to 1679px to reach the 100% scale setting for this section *noting standard monitor size with default zoom levels at 100%* so this should meet the max 100% scale at this setting&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Notes:&#xd;
# The suggested solution here is to remove 1400px restrictions to all scalable margins&#xd;
# Alternatively, scale the paddings up 300px to handle at a minimum 16:9 aspect ratio 1080p monitors by increasing all 1400px limitaions to a 1700px restriction&#xd;

You can use the CSS Andras provided with any browser plugin that allows you to add custom styles to a page/site/domain. Keep in mind that it will only make the changes for you; it's not something you as an admin can apply to your site. Every user who wants it will need to do it themselves.&#xd;

Nearly a quarter of my screen is now wasted space.  Why would you force both of the new view panes to be smaller than the old view (i.e. this one)?  I use a smaller high resolution laptop and this makes reviewing requests/issues really tiresome.</text><author>Katie Yoder</author></comments><comments><text>I have to agree with the previous posters.  This new design is just plainly STUPID.&#xd;
&#xd;
The new UI uses too much white space.  We have to do more vertical and horizontal scrolling now, which has adversely impacted productivity.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
I used the following in UserCss to reduce the vertical white space in the right pane:&#xd;

div.KpNgj, div.lmymNt {&#xd;
 margin-bottom: 0px !important;&#xd;

I have the same problem. I want to see the logs messages posted in a ticket without having to use horizontal scroll bar since that makes it very difficult to make sense of the logs. These messages are in the middle pane which is too narrow. I have a widescreen monitor, but it's of no use. I would like to nuke the right pane and widen the middle pane to view the logs. &#xd;

Honestly just add the ability to minimize the right side panel like you do the left side panel. This would be a quick fix that would satisfy most of the issue.&#xd;

If you want to really impress people let the user resize the pane manually but that's secondary.</text><author>forde.prigot</author></comments><comments><text>is there any update on this?&#xd;

&#xd;
The account's username is shown. Usernames should never be shown in the UI.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To get more information on the Default Reporter, you need to open the configuration.</description><createDate>2020-06-23T22:29:44.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - July 26, 2022|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}
Hi everyone,

Thank you for previously raising this bug and bringing it to our attention.

Within our company roadmap and work capacity, we try to address or review each bug request but admit that not each one will be resolved. To continue the culture of being honest and open, we are closing this bug to focus on our upcoming roadmap for all Jira users.

As we continue to roll out features we do look at requests made by our users and if you feel like this bug is still impacting your team please let us know.

Thank you again for providing valuable feedback to our team!

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
'Log in as user' function shows incorrect 'Your Work' screen information&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Go to [Admin hub|https://admin.atlassian.com]&#xd;
# Select a user to use the *Log in as user* function&#xd;
# The landing page of *Your Work* does not show the user logged information&#xd;
#* Or Alternatively: go to People > Search people and teams, and then attempt to see the work of any other user.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* *Your Work* screen should show the user currently logged information and not the user that is impersonating&#xd;
* *Viewing the work of other users* shows the issues the user is/was working on that the user impersonated can see.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* *Your Work* landing page shows the activity from the user that is impersonating.&#xd;
* *Viewing the work of other users* will show issue keys and issue summaries of the issues the admin user can see (the impersonator), not the ones the user being impersonated would be able to see. It is important to mention the user impersonated in this way is still not able to access those issues that they do not have permissions to, but the issue keys and description can be seen.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
I (re)discovered this bug while I was overhauling the Permission Schemes at my organization. I thought I could trust the "Log in as user" functionality to give me accurate visibility to what that user would see in Jira. Apparently I was wrong.&#xd;
&#xd;
Fortunately in my case, I was testing against a "test user" (not an actual employee). I created this test user (along with a sham Atlassian account for that test user) so that I would have the login credentials for that test user. That allowed me to employ the likely only *workaround* to this bug – actually authenticating as that test user in Jira.&#xd;
&#xd;
Why am I bothering to comment on this closed bug ticket? Because it's important for Atlassian to know that *TRUST IS IMPORTANT*, particularly when it comes to instance security. Apparently I can't trust that "Log in as user" will show me accurate user-visibility results, and Atlassian is OK with that. My trust level for that entire feature is now minimal.&#xd;
&#xd;
Perhaps Atlassian would at least consider warning admins who use the "Log in as user" feature about all the known limitations that it has. That would at least restore a little trust for this feature.</text><author>Mykenna Cepek</author></comments><comments><text>How can this bug not be important to ATTLASIAN?</text><author>Jesus Rodriguez(G)</author></comments><comments><text>Hi, [~1dd3e571b5a1], this bug only causes an admin impersonating a user to see issues that the admin themselves have permission to see instead of that of the user impersonated, so no information is actually leaked or vulnerated. If you have a case of information leaked or exposed due to something related to this, please feel free to share it in a support request for our team to investigate.</text><author>Rene C. [Atlassian Support]</author></comments><comments><text>The point is not a data leak. Leaking data in Jira to a Jira administrator is admittedly not a concern.&#xd;
&#xd;
The concern, as I tried to make clear in my comment here on 16-Aug-2021, is that I cannot trust this feature as an administrator to show me what Jira looks like when I am "logged in as" another user.&#xd;
&#xd;
The ability of an Admin to trust this "impersonation" capability is undercut by this bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is not a security issue. This is an obvious bug which erodes the trust of Jira administrators when performing administration functions in Jira.&#xd;
&#xd;
I will also note that the workaround I offered ONLY works when the administrator has access to the impersonated user's email. In other words, the workaround will NOT work in most real-world cases.</text><author>Mykenna Cepek</author></comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - June 23, 2023|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The post function to update the field "Time Spent", doesnot update the value in the issue after transition.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Edit the workflow&#xd;
 # Add Post Function on Create Issue transition / or any transition&#xd;
 # Update Issue Field: Time Spent and value: 1m&#xd;
 # Publish&#xd;
 # Create Issue&#xd;
 # Go to Reports > Time Tracking Report > Next&#xd;

&#xd;
Time Spent column updated with value&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Time Spent column is empty&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Enter the time in seconds in the field value to add 1 minute using the {_}Post Function{_}. Avoid using characters like _s, m, h, or d_ in the _Update Issue Field_ configuration. The value for the _Time spent_ field you should enter is {*}_+60+_{*}.

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When configuring a *Default Configuration Scheme* for a Custom field to have a default value, that default value is still being added to the associated Issue type even though the field is not included in the Screen layout.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Configure a Custom field to have a default value (ie : Single text field)&#xd;
# Make sure that the Custom field is not included in any Screens associated with the Issue type&#xd;
!Configure_Screen_-_JIRA.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
!Configure_Custom_Field__TEXT_FIELD__SINGLE__-_JIRA.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Because the field is not included in the Screen, no value should be associated with the field as it is not in use.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Behind the scenes, that default value is added to the Issue and can be seen in the Issue Navigator.&#xd;
&#xd;
 !Issue_navigator_-_JIRA.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
This is applicable for all Custom field types.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
As a workaround, you can adjust the Applicable contexts for the scheme so that the default value is only applicable to specific Issue types.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Time to First Response bar graph gadget producing strange results&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Configure a Time to First Response bar graph gadget (Jira gadget, not JSD one)&#xd;
# View the data in the gadget and click on a bar to drill down&#xd;
# Notice the drill downed data doesn't seem to relate to the graph&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Seemingly unrelated results.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using the below example and confirming tickets had a comment made, my manual calculations came to an average of ~45m for Time to First Response. The gadget is showing 10 hours.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira cloud, the [CHART]Time in Status which is using the customer field type *Time in Status* is used for reporting in [average time in status gadget|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-use-average-time-in-status-gadget-776998092.html]. Within the custom field configuration, a user is allowed to create a custom field using the *Time in Status* type. This can further be misinterpreted as a standard field type containing data that is user readable.  &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a new custom field&#xd;
# Choose the type *Time in Status*.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
*Time in Status* should not be configurable as this field type is not meant to contain data that can be directly used by end users. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
*Time in Status* can be configured and further be added to screens. The actual field created cannot be edited nor viewed. &#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
JRACLOUD-60841 is the existing feature request to actually allow reporting of time in status for individual Jira issues. </description><createDate>2019-01-17T11:19:49.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - October 28, 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a validator *Field has been modified Validator* is set on a transition for a "Text Field (multi-line)" field, the transition goes through even if it's not being modified during the transition.&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a custom field with type *Text Field (multi-line)*&#xd;
 # Set default value of the custom field.&#xd;
 # Add *Field has been modified Validator* validator (with an error message) to a transition to check if the field's value is being updated during transition&#xd;
 # Add a screen, that contains the field&#xd;
 # Create an issue and add a value to the custom field in edit/view issue screen&#xd;
 # Transition the issue using the transition in which the validator is set. Do not update/modify the field's value during transition&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Issue could not be transitioned as the field's value is not being modified during the transition&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
The transition goes through even if the field's value is not updated&#xd;
h3. Note&#xd;
&#xd;
If the field is empty and it has never a value the validator works fine and the validator error message appears during the transition. But if the field has a value, or it has value previously and is empty now, the validator does not work.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the *Value Field* condition: "The field &lt;Field Name> will have to be not equal to value 'NULL'. Compared as String."&#xd;
_(change the Field as per your site)_&#xd;

&#xd;
We use internal multi-text fields to ensure we do not expose comments to the customer in error.

If the information is not updated under the multi text field is not entered, it causes escalation issues across projects.</text><author>Tracy J</author></comments><comments><text>This really impact us as we are still educating our users how to write proper descriptions and without this they will not update it and goes back to useless descriptions</text><author>Benjie</author></comments><comments><text>The description should read:&#xd;

 &#xd;
&#xd;
When transitioning a ticket, if a validator is set to require a modification on a custom multi-text field, the validator does not trigger.

The bug has a high impact on our business as most of our transitions have validators on multi-line text fields.</text><author>Tracy J</author></comments><comments><text>my scenario is:&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Customer who are Transitioning Multiple issues at once (Bulk Operation) have noticed that the Bulk Operation Completes but no actions are made on the Issues.  If a Validator is on the Transition is not met, the Bulk Operation 'completes' without error however does not transition the issues. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Cloud &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Configure a "Field has been modified Validator" on a Workflow Transition: eg Time Spent Field should be modified during the transition | Error Message: This field is required&#xd;
# Publish workflow&#xd;
# In Issue Navigator, attempt to Bulk Edit and Transition issues using the Workflow with a Validator&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
If the Validator is not Met, display an error message&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Bulk Operation runs through and looks like it completes successfully. Issues that were Bulk Edited were not changed. &#xd;
&#xd;
In Jira logs; using the Time Spent example:&#xd;
{noformat}  	 logger:	 com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator	&#xd;
  	 message:	 Could not get time spent from the transition	{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
If an Issue is manually transitioned using the Transition Buttons and the Validator is not Met, an error is displayed&#xd;
Time Spent/Log Work cannot be done in Bulk:&#xd;
{noformat}N/A	Change Log Work	NOTE: This field is not available for bulk update operations.{noformat}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
If using a Time Spent/Log Work Validator - Remove it from the Workflow Transition or Manually Transition the issue&#xd;
If other Custom Fields, ensure that they are present on the Screen used in the Workflow Transition and are Populated during the Bulk Operation&#xd;

h3. Summary
When trying to quick create an issue in a JIRA backlog with many issues, the issue type cannot be rendered on the screen because the types are cut off by the bottom of the browser window. Note: this only occurs when the number of issues in the backlog consumes the majority of the screen.

h3. Steps to Reproduce
# Create a JIRA Scrum project
# Create a large number of issues for your backlog
# Depending on the size of your screen, the number required to trigger the bug will vary. Essentially you will need the backlog to reach the bottom fourth of the screen.
# Try creating a new issue and changing the issue type for the backlog by clicking the down arrow next to *What needs to be done?* 

h3. Expected Results
The pop up box displays the full list of issue types as shown below:
!expected_view.png|thumbnail!
h3. Actual Results
The full list of issue types is not displayed because the pop-up window is cut off by the bottom of the browser window, as shown below:

We need to transfer the issue status to the external system, so we've made up the workflow with the "trigger a webhook post function". The webhook should only work with transitions, so no issue events are selected.&#xd;
&#xd;
It works unstable - sometimes webhook fires immediately after the transition and all the reauired info is posted in the external system.&#xd;
Sometimes it works with the time delay (various time intervals).&#xd;
Sometimes it doesnt fire at all.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is only logged when the webhook was sent successfuly. &#xd;
We've tried all the options from https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-41388, but all connections are ok.&#xd;
&#xd;
Are there any other suggestions of the possible reason of the problem?</description><createDate>2016-04-07T11:34:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi, we are experiencing this issue too, has there been any update?

So if webhook worked SUCCESSfully, this field is never empty.

Afterwards in all the cases when the success-field is empty (JQL filter) , the external system 'asks' JIRA to send the tickets again - and we do this check by job every 10 minutes.

If I switch the webhook to be triggered by an Issue, updated event, it works and I get the post inside Teams (this proves it's not an https issue, or bad url).

&#xd;
I've tried to move my Post Function above or below the other Post Function "Fire a *Issue Resolved* event that can be processed by the listeners", no difference.&#xd;

A possible resolution for this one would be to have an event for "issue resolved" in the event section. But it won't help for other custom workflow transitions.&#xd;

{quote} * Post function webhooks do not fire if added to the *Create Issue* workflow transition. We recommend that you configure your web hook to fire from the *issue_created* event instead.{quote}&#xd;

Hi,&#xd;
&#xd;
I believe this issue should be resolved soon. As Atlassian has changed that automations to now have a limit but the only workaround I can find to have webhooks work in any case is by using automations. For our instance our webhooks do not work. They are not sending the information out as they are configured. We then have to use automations to achieve what we need which now have limits so now we have to use more automations which may cause us to reach our automation limits.</text><author>Gerry Ultreras</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>WebHook convert the space character %20 into %2520 thus failing the call.</summary><key>JRACLOUD-42579</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-42579</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}&#xd;

For most characters this is nice behavior, but it also replaces the % characters that are part of an already encoded character.

Since the url encoding contains a % character as well, these encodings will also be replaced. So if you save a link to url "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1 password", it will be changed to "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1%20password". If you open the link editor for the same link (don't change the URL) and save, the URL will be transformed to "http://sample.com/executions?argString=-sshPassword1%2520password". so the % sign is replaced by %25, changing %20 into %2520. One can repeat the process, adding 25 after the % sign at every attempt (%252520, ...).

For any other apps except Jira, threading works perfectly. 

Based on the observation of our Jira Administrators, the problem is that Jira links to a non-existing (virtual) Message-id in "In-Reply-To" header item, which is causing the problem in Outlook. </text><author>Jan Jasek</author></comments><comments><text>After reading various internet forums and issues here in JIRA on threading, I've found why MSO is failing to thread mail notification sent from our JIRA.

MSO (connected via Exchange Server) cannot thread e-mails with In-Reply-To refers to a non-existing (virtual) Message-ID. After I was able to amend JIRA e-mails so that "In-Reply-To" always refers to an existing message-id, then threading started to work.

How JIRA sends e-mails today:
{noformat}
Message-ID: &lt;JIRA.14835.1358950859000.465.1358951193690@xxx&gt;
In-Reply-To: &lt;JIRA.14835.1358950859000@xxx>
{noformat}
The In-Reply-To field refers to a non-existing message-id.

When threading works in JIRA:
{noformat}
Message-ID: &lt;JIRA.14835.1358950859000.465.1358951193690@xxx>
In-Reply-To: &lt;JIRA.14835.1358950859000.465.1358951193689@xxx>
{noformat}
Where In-Reply-To refers to the *existing* e-mail - e.g. the last e-mail sent or the very original e-mail (upon creating).

I understand why Atlassian implemented JRA-9979 but I assume that this change caused threading to fail in MSO since then. We would highly appreciate if Atlassian could change using message-ids in In-Reply-To always to an existing e-mail.</text><author>Radek Janata</author></comments><comments><text>[~radek.janata]
It is true that JIRA is using a virtual In-Reply-To, however the mystery of why Outlook/Exchange is failing to thread properly is a bit complicated.

First of all, our testing shows that threading works fine in Outlook when connected to email servers other than Exchange (we tested against GMail).
Secondly, it is reported that other email clients (eg Thunderbird) still thread correctly when connected to Exchange 2010.
So, the problem seems to be in the specific combination of Outlook and Exchange 2010.
If any of the internet forums you visited gave any clues as to why the combination is important, I would be interested in you posting the URLs.

In addition, two users above have both mentioned that this works fine in Exchange 2007.
So Microsoft changed something in Exchange 2010 that broke this. Yet another reason to consider this as an Outlook/Exchange bug.
</text><author>Mark Lassau</author></comments><comments><text>A thought experiment. Imagine the following scenario:

* User U1 sends an email to user U2
These users are using some other email server than Exchange.
This message gets sent with a message ID of, say, "m1".
* Next U2 replies to that email and CCs user U3
Call this message "m2"
U3 is on Exchange Server and is using Outlook.
This email will be sent with a Reply-To of "m1"
Neither the Outlook instance nor the Exchange server have ever seen the message-id "m1", and yet "it exists".
* U2 learns some more information and replies again to message "m1" CCing U3
(or perhaps you can imagine the original email was sent to two users who both reply and CC U3)
Call this message "m3"
This email will also be sent with a Reply-To of "m1"

Now, do you expect that U3's email client should be smart enough to thread m2 and m3 together even though it has not actually seen m1?

Note that even though neither the Outlook client nor the Exchange server have ever seen the message-id "m1", there is no way that they can know if the message-d is "real" or "virtual".
SMTP has no central server, it is a network of independant servers, so there is no "real" or "virtual" message-ids, there is just "I have seen this before" or "I have not seen this before".</text><author>Mark Lassau</author></comments><comments><text>bq. We would highly appreciate if Atlassian could change using message-ids in In-Reply-To always to an existing e-mail.

When we send notifications, we send separate emails to each user because they can have different language and email format settings, so every user receives a unique message-id that no other user has seen. What we don't want to do is store a cross-product "In-Reply-To" value for every user/issue combination.
(That's kind of what we used to do and needed to fix in JRA-9979 )

I guess we could store the very first message-id sent for a given Issue and then always use that as the In-Reply-To for further notifications on that issue.

This assumes that we just need Exchange to have seen the message-id at least once, not the Outlook client.

It also assumes that JIRA is sending email always to one single Exchange Server: if the SMTP server is a gateway that sends the message to different servers for different users then this won't work.
So it might work for an internal JIRA instance in a corporate environment with a single email server, but the same users would probably not get threaded issues from, say, jira.atlassian.com.</text><author>Mark Lassau</author></comments><comments><text>[~mlassau], thanks for the thorough answer. You're right and I haven't realize the scenarios you mentioned. Tracking every message-id sent would mean to revert back to NotificationInstance table removed within JRA-9979.

Would you please consider this minimal adjustment you've mentioned?
bq. I guess we could store the very first message-id sent for a given Issue and then always use that as the In-Reply-To for further notifications on that issue.
This would help to some users at least (those who receive also the very first message). For users that haven't received the first message (added later during an issue resolution) this change would have no effect/impact. Thanks.</text><author>Radek Janata</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,

[Atlassian].</text><author>Oswaldo Hernandez</author></comments><comments><text>Based on my review of the technical issues with MS Exchange, it appears that as of Exchange 2010, threading _requires_ the use of {{Message-Id}} and {{In-Reply-To}} headers that reference actual emails which were sent. I understand the technical problem of having JIRA track every email sent, per user, for every JIRA issue.

Let me propose that in our use case, it would be acceptable that email threading would only apply to email sent in some (configurable) time-frame, say for the current day or the past week. That way, you could garbage-collect whatever tracking table is needed to associate email message IDs to each issue/user pair. This could be similar to the LastViewed metadata (which, by default, only tracks the last 50 issues seen by a user).</text><author>Wratko Hlavina</author></comments><comments><text>All messages about each issue can be considered as a separate conversation so all JIRA has to do is to keep a messageID corresponsing to each JIRA issue and use it when sending email about that issue.</text><author>Emre Toptancı [OBSS]</author></comments><comments><text>My review finds that the {{In-Reply-To}} must correspond to a {{Message-Id}} of an email that was actually sent to the recipient; it's not sufficient for it to be an email that exists but was sent to another Exchange recipient.

  {panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce:&#xd;
1. Create a shared filter having similar JQL:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
project in (PROJECT1, PROJECT2) ORDER BY created DESC&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
2. Login as a user having only browse permission for "PROJECT2".&#xd;
3. View the filter in issue navigator.&#xd;
4. It shows user the number of issues allowed to see. Add a "filter results" gadget on the dashboard.&#xd;
5. Select the filter.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Result:&#xd;
The user gets error message "The selected filter filter-&lt;ID> has an error: A value with ID '&lt;ID>' does not exist for the field 'project'..&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected:&#xd;
Here also user should be able to view issues from project having browse permission.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Update&#xd;
&#xd;
The same happens when issue keys are specified in the filter query, but then the issues have a security level whose the login user does not have permissions on. In that case the issue key will be replaced by the issue ID in the search when opening the results, which breaks the search:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Issue does not exist or you do not have permission to see it.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
Attempting to access the XML view of a filter with this configuration will result in a HTTP 400 with an error similar to "HTTP Status 400 - A value with ID '10000' does not exist for the field 'project'." as per the attached image.</description><createDate>2010-04-07T04:00:34.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Attaching screenshot.</text><author>Veenu Bharara</author></comments><comments><text>This is due to the fact that JQL execution treats explicit project selection as an error. We need to rethink this. Maybe parametise the JQL executor to not do this for shared filter usage from a gadget.</text><author>Chris Mountford</author></comments><comments><text>We would be very glad if you could pay attention to this problem, because it is an annoying handicap when using shared dashboards.</text><author>SimoneK</author></comments><comments><text>Just some thoughts on this...

The problem seems to be that filters can be shared with people who do not have access to some projects. We could fix this in a number of ways:
* unshare the filters with people who lack the appropriate permissions for that filter, or
* instead of failing the JQL search, we could silently just remove that query section.</text><author>Eric Dalgliesh</author></comments><comments><text>Has there been any progress on this issue?

Thanks for expressing your interest in this fix, unfortunately this is not currently in the short-term backlog for an upcoming JIRA maintenance release.

Having said that, this is still an issue we would like to fix when we are working trough other bugs in the Gadgets area. Please watch this issue as I will update it as soon as new information becomes available.

In the meanwhile, as a workaround, users should still be able to see the results of the shared filter via the issue navigator. 

We are sorry that this is causing pain for your users, and I hope the additional information helps.

[Atlassian].</text><author>Oswaldo Hernandez</author></comments><comments><text>I've seen a couple of issues like this one where someone from Atlassian puts an "occurrence factor" on the issue that estimates the prevalence of the problem.  I'm curious about how Atlassian arrives at the percentage given.  I know they probably have good data on the cloud-based instances, but I wonder how much insight they have into server-based instances.

In our case:  when a project is over, we assign it a permission scheme that makes it readonly for everyone.  After a time, we make the project hidden altogether.   In addition, our security team makes us pretty diligent about removing people's access to projects when they move on to other assignments.  It seems like there are probably plenty of companies like mine who choose to run server-based instances behind firewalls for a reason.   Security is one of those reasons, so I would think there are other server-based instances whose security policies are similar to ours.   I only have one vote on this issue, but we have 5000+ users in our instance.</text><author>DaveT</author></comments><comments><text>It is definitely not what I would expect to happen. If a user doesn't have permission to view a project, then the gadget results should simply not include that data. Not error out</text><author>MattS</author></comments><comments><text>Hi all,

Just a quick status update. 

In order to be able to tackle this bug, it would be necessary to implement the improvement described at JRA-40245.

[Atlassian].</text><author>Oswaldo Hernandez</author></comments><comments><text>I also commented in JRA-40245 but wanted to comment here as well since these are related issues...

We have an agile board with multiple "customers" (represented by projects) and we want to share access to the board (specifically the backlog view) with those users who have "BROWSE" access to ONE of several projects.. HOWEVER, we can't do this because the users must currently have "BROWSE" permission on ALL of the projects returned from the shared filter (which drives the issues in the board). Today, when the users who are restricted to view a single project login, they see the board with NO ISSUES because of the limitation of the filter.

Ideally, as described above, if I have filter criteria which includes a project for which a user has BROWSE permission, they will see those results which are related to the specific project issues they are permitted to BROWSE.

This would allow us as a consulting company to share our sprint boards and our backlog views with our customers, without creating separate boards and running sprints for each customer separately.

I would argue that making this change would be critically valuable when it comes to running a collaborative sprint with mixed permissions.</text><author>Sean Hayes</author></comments><comments><text>Due to an extended period of inactivity and low interest this bug has been auto-closed.

 # Set up DC environment (v9.12.4) with MySQL v8 and A4J built in version v9.1.1.&#xd;
 # Create an automation rule from (tested on global automation) and create actions to trigger the rule. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When you change the state of a work items the "Accepted Date" is updated with the expect timestamp at the moment of the state is changed to  "Accepted".&#xd;
It is observed that the "Accepted date" changes always even with any update being made on the work-items in ADO for example adding a tag or change the title.&#xd;
&#xd;
Business Impact&#xd;
&#xd;
This gives all wrong reports to the stakeholders.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Create a Work-item in JA and sync with ADO&#xd;
 * Change the State of the WorkItem to "Accepted", the "Accepted Date" is update with the date (in UI is not visible the time), in the image is 11 March&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2025-03-12-12-35-44-919.png|width=486,height=384!&#xd;
 *  The second day update the work-item in ADO, for example change the title or add a tag&#xd;
 * Wait for the sync&#xd;
 * You can observe that the "Accepted Date" is change to 12th of March&#xd;
 * This change reflect in Enterprise Insight as well&#xd;

Doing a quick add of Dependency from Epic/Capacity slide-out does not prefill title/description. It only pre-fills the PI/depends-on and gives the user to add title and description to the dependency.&#xd;

 # Navigate to Program Board, select 1 PI in the left filter, it should have some associated work items&#xd;
 # Open a new JA tab, can be any page with left PI filter, for example Portfolio Room&#xd;
 # Remove PI from filter, apply, close this second tab&#xd;

After adding a user as group Admin Ideation > Setup > admins, the user is not able to change/ update its assigned Ideation Group.&#xd;
&#xd;
By adding the permission toggle *Ideation -> Manage Groups* this same user it gains has access to update, create and delete *all* the groups even the ones he doesn't have access to as admin/ contributor.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
It's possible to create an idea without a category/type selected, and this idea will not show in the UI.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
If the category field doesn't show or is removed from the new idea form, the form can be submitted without any error and an idea is created without category.&#xd;
&#xd;
This sometimes happens at random when creating ideas.  For whatever reason, the category field doesn't populate and isn't saved when the idea is created.  I cannot reproduce this on demand, but it does happen.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Typically, it's not possible to leave the category field blank, there's always a default option. Creating an idea via API also fills in the default category, even when we specify an invalid or null category. So it's expected the category will default to first choice and can be changed later.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
An idea created this way gets categoryId=null, and while it shows in the count, it can't be accessed via a card.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2023-08-30-18-05-38-209.png|thumbnail!&#xd;

It is possible to find these ideas via API and remove them 1 by 1 via browser. We recommend doing so with care. If you're not sure about the below steps or have other questions, please reach out to support.&#xd;
 # Use API to get the idea id&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user stars an item in a Custom Room, the name of the starred item appears identical to a similar item in a different Custom Room. &#xd;
This is due to the Custom Hierarchy name selected is not showing in the item description.&#xd;
&#xd;
For any other work level, the selection show accordingly, making the starred selection easily differentiated&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # go to custom rooms&#xd;
 # Select a custom hierarchy and (optional) select a PI &#xd;
 # go to any grid that can be starred, for example Features grid&#xd;
 # Star the selection&#xd;
 # Go to home and look for the starred item&#xd;
 # Notice that the selection who that it is for a custom room, but fails to show the selection&#xd;
PI if selected is showing accordingly&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The selected hierarchy name should show accordingly when listing the starred items.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The selected hierarchy is not showing when it is set as a custom hierarchy&#xd;
&#xd;
Another work levels, like portfolio, program, team, etc... show the selection as expected&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In a Jira Align configuration that is integrated to Jira and uses State Mappings in the Process Flow to match a Jira Align State with more than one Jira Align Process step, then setting the Process Step for a story to the second one configured for a specific state incorrectly sets the first process step instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
If the same change is attempted against a feature then the correct (second) process step is set&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In a Jira integrated configuration use a Jira Workflow that has more statuses than the number of states in Jira Align. &#xd;
 # Setup corresponding Process Flows for Stories and Features  in Jira Align and make sure that Paths 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5 in the following article are all configured to match the work/process flows (also make sure that process steps are enabled in the details panel settings for stories and features)  [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Align-articles/Mapping-States-Steps-and-Statuses-between-Jira-Align-and-Jira/ba-p/1354724] This will result in some JA States being mapped to more than one Jira State and more the one JA Process Step.&#xd;
 # Create at least one feature and story in Jira (leaving them both in the initial status) and wait for these work items to be created in Jira Align.&#xd;
 # Use API GET request against the Process Flows (from Step 2) to list the numeric IDs of the process steps for stories and features.&#xd;
 # Then using the order of the Process Steps, as defined in the process flow for stories, attempt, using a PATCH REST API call, to change the processStepId of a story  to the 2nd step (related to the same JA State)&#xd;
 # After submitting the patch call, either using a GET call or by refreshing the story in the JA UI, check to see what the process step has been set to.&#xd;
 # If the story is a child of the feature, then set the story back to the first step in the process flow (as a child story can change the state of a parent feature this is necessary to avoid confusion)&#xd;
 # Repeat  the same test  (steps 5 to 7) but against the feature&#xd;
 # Doing a similar test but using the JA UI seems to work correctly for both stories and features. &#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
Both the story and the feature PATCH call to change the processStepId should correctly set the Process Step even when two Process Steps are mapped to the same State.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
While the feature sets the correct process step if attempting to set the second process step linked to a state then the first Process Step linked to that same state will be incorrectly set instead &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
The report TeamHierarchy report is a report accessible from the Strategy level in the new navigation&#xd;
This report is used to display the full hierarchy based on the  Organization Structure  selected in a snapshot&#xd;
&#xd;
If a snapshot takes a large  Organization Structure  that englobes the whole organization, for very large company structures, this report gets excessively slow, over a minute to load&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to Strategy/Enterprise and select a large snapshot&#xd;
# Go to more Item and select Organizational Hierarchy&#xd;
# Notice the report takes a long time to load&#xd;
Note: This is applicable for very large organization &#xd;
&#xd;

You really need to prevent imports from updating the Themes directly on a Feature (essentially bypassing the parenting of a Feature by an Epic and then rolling up to the Theme that is the parent of that Epic).  &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on the Data Center: (yes) &#xd;
&#xd;
When managing or creating an Ideation group, the dropdown options 'Select all' and 'Deselect All' present different and conflicting behavior when the total amount of users is greater than 150 and affects both old and new nav&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Access JA > Ideation > hit 'Setup'&#xd;
 # Click 'Create New Group' or edit an existing one&#xd;
 # Fill in the Title and select the type (results will be the same) if necessary&#xd;
 # In the Admins/Internal contributor dropdown, hit 'Select All' and notice that 150 users were selected despite the total amount (which should be greater than 150)&#xd;
 # Scroll down to the last user selected and hit 'Select All' again, totalizing 300 users selected&#xd;
 # Click on 'Deselect All' and confirm the action&#xd;
 # Notice that the list is now clear, all the 300 users were deselected&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When you click on 'Selecting All', the system should automatically select all users based on the total amount, rather than selecting a fixed number of 150 users.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the total amount of users is greater than 150, using the 'Select All' option only selects 150 users at a time. On the other hand, the 'Deselect All' option unselects all the users regarding the total amount of users previously selected&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

Selecting users in batches of 150 until all of them are selected.</description><createDate>2023-10-04T15:14:37.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Adding more than 4000 Internal Contributors to an Idea Group causes performance issues on Idea Group</summary><key>JIRAALIGN-4946</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JIRAALIGN-4946</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When adding internal contributors to an ideation group, adding over 4000 users to a group at once causes the screen to freeze and the side panel to not correctly close when save and close is selected. Users will eventually save, but then editing that Idea group further has performance issues.  This is challenging due the fact that bulk user management for internal contributors cannot be managed any other way. There is no supported API endpoint or import/export for them.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Go to an Ideation Group>Setup page.&#xd;
# Select Internal Contributors&#xd;
# Scroll down the list of users until you have at least 4000 'Shown" users then select all.&#xd;
# Select Save and Close. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Results save and add the users to the Idea Group then close the side panel and an 'Updated Group Successfully' is displayed. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Screen freezes, occasionally displaying browser based "Page is unresponsive" dialogs eventually resulting in a Jira Align page error "Error on Server."   Reloading the page, the group will also display blank fields for internal contributors for a significant amount of time in which the screen cannot be edited until the internal contributors populate. Any edits on the page will also result in the save behavior until the internal contributors are removed.&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the Browser Console, repeated 3 times per attempt:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user doesn't have any products assigned to them, clicking ... > *Resend invite* has no effect. This is by design and an invitation email is not sent to users who don't have any product access.&#xd;
&#xd;
The previous Bug ticket: [ID-8080|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ID-8080] was closed due to the reported behavior being expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
This Bug ticket aims to correct the feedback message so admins are aware of the situation and knows that invitation emails are not expected to be sent or prompt the admin to assign the end user product access(license).&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to admin.atlassian.com and select your organization&#xd;
 # Click "Directory" > "Users"&#xd;
 # Find a user who doesn't have any product access&#xd;
 # On the user's account, click ... > "Resend invite"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The admin should receive an error message stating something like:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Invitation email is not sent&#xd;
This user doesn't have any products assigned. Please assign at least 1 product to the end user.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Additionally, if there are no products selected, the UI should deactivate and gray out the *Send invitation* option as no invitation email will be triggered even if the option is selected.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The message below is displayed in the UI, but the no invites are actually sent. This is confusing behavior&#xd;
{quote}Reminder sent!&#xd;
&#xd;
An email has been sent to the user to complete their account activation.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Setting a provisioned group on the new admin UI as a default access group leads to an error.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) / (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Provision a group in the new admin UI&#xd;
 # Set the provisioned group as a license group&#xd;
 # Set the provisioned group as a default access group&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The UI should not allow the provisioned group to be set as a default access group as it is read-only. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The UI will return a vague error on not being able to set the provisioned group as a default access group&#xd;

There was a problem updating the default group setting. Please try again in a few minutes.&#xd;

&#xd;
 !error.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The default access group is used when inviting the end users directly via the site administration and only non-provisioned groups can be set as a default access group.&#xd;
&#xd;
This should not prevent admins from setting provisioned groups as license groups and grant license via AD group membership.</description><createDate>2022-07-06T11:46:30.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Italian translation for the Description of the validator 'Field Required Validator' in Jira is incorrect</summary><key>I18N-4430</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/I18N-4430</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>When creating a new validator under a transition, the Italian translation for the Description of the validator 'Field Required Validator' in Jira is incorrect:&#xd;

 We should catch these exceptions and log out a single line error message possibly just with details like the URL being requested and the type of IO error (e.g. broken pipe, connection reset by peer, etc). It may be worth still logging the full exception if debug logging is enabled because it's not inconceivable this information might be useful when diagnosing an issue. (right now the full stack trace as above is printed regardless of if debug logging is enabled)&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
When an SVN commit message that references a JIRA issue is changed to reference a different JIRA issue, and the change is indexed by FishEye/Crucible, the original JIRA issue displays the erroneous message "You don't have access to view all related commits. Please contact your administrator":&#xd;
!devpanel1.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
In addition, the Development Panel summary (the "x commits" message under the Dev Panel) for the issue which is now referenced by the commit message isn't updated.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* JIRA 6.4.5&#xd;
* FishEye 3.10.2&#xd;
** Linked to JIRA through Application Link (method: OAuth w/ 2-LO). OAuth tokens created in both sides.&#xd;
** Having a SVN repository indexed.&#xd;
* svn, version 1.7.20&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# In JIRA, create two issues - let's name them TST-1 and TST-2.&#xd;
# Perform a commit on the SVN repo, referencing TST-1. Wait for it to be indexed by FishEye, and confirm the Dev Panel summary is updated, showing *1 commit*, and that opening its details lists the commit.&#xd;
# On the SVN repository, change the commit message to reference TST-2:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
svn propset -r N --revprop svn:log "TST-2 testing change on N" URL&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
#* *N* must be replaced by the revision number for which you are editing the commit message.&#xd;
#* *URL* must be replaced by the repo's location. It's not necessary to use this parameter if you are already in the repository in the command line.&#xd;
# Go to {{FishEye Administration > Repositories}}, open the repo's config, then go to *Maintenance*. On this screen, under *Subversion Non-Versioned Properties (revprops)*, fill the fields *from* and *to* with an interval of revisions comprehending the one you changed, then click in *Start*.&#xd;
# Confirm the commit message is updated by looking at this repo's activity in FishEye.&#xd;
# Acccess the TST-1 issue in JIRA, then click in the *x commit", which won't be updated. You won't see the revision previously linked to this issue, and the message "You don't have access to view all related commits. Please contact your administrator" will be displayed, similarly to:&#xd;
#* !devpanel1.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* After the non-versioned properties of the revision are re-indexed, the Development Panel should be updated to reflect the commits that are actually linked to each issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* The Development Panel isn't properly updated, displaying wrong results:&#xd;
** For TST-1, it will keep showing the "x commits" link, but its content will be the erroneous message "You don't have access to view all related commits. Please contact your administrator".&#xd;
** For TST-2, the Development Panel summary isn't updated, so there will be no "x commits" link, if this issue didn't have any commit previously linked to it.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
* This seems to be strictly related to the Development Panel, since the *Source* tab properly displays the new information right away.&#xd;
&#xd;
*What DOES NOT help*&#xd;
* Refreshing FishEye/Crucible caches at {{JIRA Administration > Add-ons > FishEye Configuration}} (I believe this is because these caches are for the JIRA FishEye Plugin, while the Development Panel is managed by the Development Integration Plugin).&#xd;
* Restarting JIRA.&#xd;
* Re-creating the application link.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
I couldn't find a proper workaround around for this, but I observed that:&#xd;
* After 30 minutes, when JIRA runs the job to collect new information from FishEye, the data in the Development Panel is properly adjusted (both the summary and the details).&#xd;
* Sometimes, committing a new change seems to clean the Development Panel details - i.e. the number of commits displayed in the summary is still wrong, but the wrong message isn't displayed anymore when opening the Dev Panel. This seems to be intermittent.</description><createDate>2016-03-10T22:38:42.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>[~grefosco], So we saw this happen once but can't reproduce it?</text><author>mwatson</author></comments><comments><text>[~mwatson@atlassian.com],&#xd;

&#xd;
This issue is being handled by Support. If you have a specific issue with Forge and your VPN, please investigate and if it's reproducible on different networks and environments then open an Ecosystem Support ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please also review documentation such as&#xd;

&#xd;
Rovo Agent icons are getting cut off at the default Rovo chat window width and in the Browse Agents list, particularly with non-Atlassian apps. This issue appears to be caused by long app or developer names that compress the icons. Interestingly, Atlassian apps do not experience this issue, possibly due to their use of inline SVG images. Additionally, the problem does not occur in the "Last used app" section at the bottom of the "Chat."&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Details can be found in the ECOHELP ticket: https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ECOHELP-60347&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
App icons should not get cut off in the “Browse Agents” list when the app or developer name are long enough to use up more than one line in non-Atlassian Apps.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Actual results and screenshots can be found in the [ticket|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ECOHELP-60347]&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary:&#xd;
&#xd;
The UIKit *UserPicker* component displays an inconsistent height compared to the standard *Select* component. This discrepancy can lead to visual misalignment and a lack of uniformity in the user interface. Ensuring consistent component sizing is crucial for maintaining a polished and cohesive design throughout the application.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
The below is the sample code can be used under Frontend -> index.jsx to reproduce the issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';&#xd;
import ForgeReconciler, { Text, UserPicker, Inline,DatePicker, Box, Label, Select, xcss} from '@forge/react';&#xd;
import { invoke } from '@forge/bridge';&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
const App = () => {&#xd;
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);&#xd;
  useEffect(() => {&#xd;
    invoke('getText', { example: 'my-invoke-variable' }).then(setData);&#xd;
  }, []);&#xd;
&#xd;
  return (&#xd;
    &lt;&gt;&#xd;
      &lt;Text>Hello world!&lt;/Text>&#xd;
      &lt;Text>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}&lt;/Text>&#xd;
      &lt;Inline space={'space.200'}>&#xd;
      &lt;Box xcss={xcss({ width: '140px' })}>&#xd;
      &lt;Label>Start Date&lt;/Label>&#xd;
      &lt;DatePicker&#xd;
            placeholder={'1977-04-30'}&#xd;
            weekStartDay={1}&#xd;
            &#xd;
          />&#xd;
        &lt;/Box>&#xd;
  &lt;Box xcss={xcss({ width: '140px' })}>&#xd;
    &lt;Label>End Date&lt;/Label>&#xd;
    &lt;DatePicker&#xd;
      placeholder={'2045-04-30'}&#xd;
      weekStartDay={1}&#xd;
    />&#xd;
  &lt;/Box>&#xd;
  &lt;Box xcss={xcss({ width: '200px' })}>&#xd;
    &lt;UserPicker label={'Reporter'} name={'user'} />&#xd;
  &lt;/Box>&#xd;
  &lt;Box xcss={xcss({ width: '170px' })}>&#xd;
    &lt;Label>Statuses&lt;/Label>&#xd;
    &lt;Select options={["one","two"]} isMulti />&#xd;
  &lt;/Box>&#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;/Inline>&#xd;

Issue Summary:&#xd;
&#xd;
The [UserPicker|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/user-picker/] component exhibits unexpected behaviour when used within a [popup|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/ui-kit/components/popup/], including issues with clearing selections and inadvertently closing the popup when a user is selected.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is intermittent and primarily occurs after the second instance of opening and closing the popup.&#xd;
&#xd;
Upon investigation, there is also known incompatibility with clearing the UserPicker’s defaultValues which requires clearing twice for changes to be reflected in the UI.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Forge app in Confluence that uses the Popup and User Picker component. &#xd;
 # Try and use the following code for the frontend/index.jsx below::&#xd;
 # &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
import React, { useState } from 'react';&#xd;
import ForgeReconciler, { Box, Button, Popup, Stack, UserPicker, xcss } from '@forge/react';const contentStyles = xcss({&#xd;
  padding: 'space.200',&#xd;
  display: 'flex',&#xd;
  flexDirection: 'column',&#xd;
  gap: 'space.100',&#xd;
});const App = () => {&#xd;
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);  const defaultValues = [&#xd;
    'xxxxx', // Default value for the first UserPicker, change to an atlassian id&#xd;
    'xxxxx', // Default value for the second UserPicker, change to an atlassian id     'xxxxx', // Default value for the third UserPicker, change to an atlassian id   ];&#xd;
  return (&#xd;
    &lt;Popup&#xd;
      isOpen={isOpen}&#xd;
      onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}&#xd;
      placement="bottom-start"&#xd;
      content={() => (&#xd;
        &lt;Box xcss={contentStyles}>&#xd;
          {[1, 2, 3].map((index) => (&#xd;
            &lt;UserPicker&#xd;
              key={index}&#xd;
              isMulti&#xd;
              label={`Assignee ${index}`}&#xd;
              placeholder="Select a user"&#xd;
              name={`user-${index}`}&#xd;
              description={`The selected user(s) will be assigned to this task ${index}`}&#xd;
              onChange={(user) => console.log(`UserPicker ${index}:`, user)}&#xd;
              defaultValue={defaultValues[index - 1]}&#xd;
            />&#xd;
          ))}&#xd;
        &lt;/Box>&#xd;

  &lt;React.StrictMode>&#xd;
    &lt;App />&#xd;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode>&#xd;
); {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * Users should be able to clear existing selections and add new ones without issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Selecting a user should not close the popup unless explicitly intended.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Clearing the UserPicker’s {{defaultValues}} should update the UI immediately without needing to clear twice.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * -Users are sometimes unable to clear selections or add new ones.- resolved&#xd;
&#xd;
 * -Selecting a user may cause the popup to close unexpectedly.- resolved&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Clearing the UserPicker’s {{defaultValues}} requires doing so twice for the UI to update.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Connect condition {{user_is_project_admin}} does not restrict users correctly&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Connect app for Jira;&#xd;
 # Add the following condition to a module: {{user_is_project_admin}}&#xd;
 # Access the module with a project admin account and verify that the resource is accessible;&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Log in with a user that is not an admin of the project and attempt to access the module;&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user is not allowed because the condition checks whether the user is a project admin, which it is not.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;

The module loads regardless of whether the user is an admin of the project or not&#xd;

&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Sorry, your username and password are incorrect - please try again.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Since the credentials are expired, rather than incorrect, the application should inform it accordingly.&#xd;
&#xd;
Even in small organizations, end-users are usually not aware of all the possible systems that manage their accounts. Thus it is time-consuming for Sys Admins to receive requests from a user trying several times to use a valid password, and then figure out what's the real issue, which it's easily resolved once the user inputs their credentials in Crowd console:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Please change your password, since your current password has expired&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Having a better message pointing out what to do, or automatically redirecting the login page to Crowd's "Change Expired Password" page would be a huge improvement.&#xd;

# Create a Delegated Directory in Crowd *pre-2.7* (e.g. Crowd 2.5.2). Make sure that the *Synchronise User Details* checkbox is checked, otherwise, the user rename feature will fail no matter what (not related to this bug)&#xd;
# Login with a couple of users in the delegated directory (so that their accounts are created in the cwd_user table)&#xd;
# Shutdown Crowd&#xd;
# Upgrade to Crowd 2.7 (tested with the in-place database upgrade method)&#xd;
# Run the following query in the Crowd Database:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
SELECT * FROM cwd_user WHERE user_name = '&lt;username>';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Replace &lt;username> with the user that is affected. Notice that their *external_id* is NULL (which is why this bug occurs).&#xd;
# Rename the user in the LDAP server itself &#xd;
# Login with the new username. If you check the cwd_user table now, you will notice that there are now 2 accounts created for the same user, 1 with the old username and 1 with the new username&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Workaround&#xd;
After the Crowd upgrade to Crowd 2.7 , make sure all users login to their accounts *at least once*, before you proceed to rename any of their usernames in the LDAP server, to avoid breaking Crowd and other Crowd-connected applications. Always check the following to see if there are any users left, with a NULL external_id:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
SELECT * FROM cwd_user WHERE external_id IS NULL;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Suggestion&#xd;
We need to have an upgrade task to force an external_id sync with the LDAP server during/immediately after the upgrade, for all users in the delegated directory</description><createDate>2013-11-04T08:55:59.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Incremental sync does not correctly pick LDAP group rename</summary><key>CWD-3606</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-3606</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h2. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
# In an AD server, create a user {{deke}} and a group (e.g. {{astronauts}}). Add {{deke}} to the group.&#xd;

We are using JIRA as a help desk system and have extended it with custom user properties (telephone number, user location, ...) using a LDAP plug-in (https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/16524). The custom properties are displayed on the user profile and issue screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
With JIRA 4.3 Atlassian revoked the support for OSUser so we can't use the plug-in anymore.&#xd;

We have set up CROWD and defined custom user attributes (telephoneNumber), but these attributes are not synchronized into JIRA.&#xd;

&#xd;
The question is: is {{C}} a nested member of {{A}}?&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently:&#xd;
- if you use the {{CachingGroupMembershipManager}}, all the group relationships are first downloaded from the server and amalgamated, and then the nesting is resolved locally on the client causing {{C}} to be a member of {{B}} and then {{B}} to be a member of {{A}}.&#xd;
- if you use the {{ApplicationServiceGeneric}}, the group relationships are calculated incrementally per directory and the final results are amalgamated causing {{C}} be a member of {{B}} only.&#xd;
&#xd;
This behaviour is highly inconsistent as it implies that using caching on the client will produce different results to making queries directly to the server.</description><createDate>2009-03-30T01:18:02.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This still needs to be discussed further by development to define what we 'think' the desired &amp; consistent behavior should be.</text><author>Justin Koke</author></comments><comments><text>[~dowoc@atlassian.com] I can help you reproduce it.

&#xd;
Just a quick update on this.&#xd;
&#xd;
This change was made intentionally to surface when a change was made by the remigration task by the system. The previous behavior did not accurately reflect when the job was run, and misattributed the change to the last user to update the page rather than the "Anonymous" user indicating a system change.&#xd;
&#xd;
The new behavior is potentially confusing, but is more accurate.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence's incremental/background indexing can occasionally come under some processing load while attempting to flush newly indexed data. This is visible as slowly increasing _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR {_}Change queue{_}. This is normal, and is something that Confluence generally overcomes on its own (given enough time, and a sufficiently suitable dip in content-creation/modification rates).&#xd;
&#xd;
{_}However{_}, if a user attempts creating a _Personal space_ in that same timeframe, the sequence of events involved while executing the {{/create-personal-space}} action also include an _immediate_ index-queue flush operation. The index-queue flush operation involves acquiring a lock on the desired index before data is written/committed to it. With incremental/background indexing already in progress (and occasionally stressed with a few pending objects to index), the {{/create-personal-space}} action can end up waiting indefinitely for a lock to execute its own one-time index-queue flush.&#xd;
&#xd;
The situation can worsen if a few more users attempt the creation of their own _Personal spaces_ in that same timeframe. Then, each {{/create-personal-space}} action will attempt executing its own one-time index-queue flush, going through the same motions of waiting to lock the desired index while other threads are still flushing/committing data to that same index.&#xd;
This sub-optimal lock-acquisition behavior then results in bringing down the overall indexing rates, which in turn show up as:&#xd;
 - constantly high (hundreds of thousands) _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR _Change queue_&#xd;
 - inaccurate search results (newly created/modified Confluence content is not yet searchable)&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
(Similar to [CONFSERVER-90319|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-90319])&#xd;
 # Setup a Confluence instance and try to push a lot of content (create new pages, comments etc.) using any kind of automation (plugins or REST API scripts).&#xd;
 # Ensure that the _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR _Change queue_ are in the thousands.&#xd;
 # Attempt creating a new _Personal space_ via _Spaces_ > _Create space_&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Provided that a _Personal space_ does not already exist for the user account in question, a new _Personal space_ should be created in a matter of a few seconds.&#xd;
Once created, content posted to that space should be searchable after a reasonable time (generally a few minutes) once the existing backlog of pending items have been indexed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The _Personal space_ creation action executes an immediate one-time index-queue flush, which in turns waits for the acquisition of a lock. &#xd;
Add a few more concurrent _Personal space_ creation actions, along with a sufficiently large and active indexing backlog, and the incremental/background indexing pace will slow down to a crawl from adhering to lock re-acquisition routines.&#xd;
&#xd;
The runtime of the http thread that triggered the _Personal space_ creation may eventually exceed Tomcat's {{StuckThreadDetectionValve}} default threshold of 60 seconds. &#xd;
That will show up in the instance's {{&lt;confluence-install-dir>/logs/catalina.*}} log:&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
[Set|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-system-properties-168002854.html] the following system property to control/specify the amount of time (in minutes) that a Confluence thread may wait for, in order to acquire a lock on a desired index:&#xd;
{code:bash}&#xd;
-Dconfluence.index.manager.lock.timeout=1&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
This will permit contending threads to timeout a lock-acquisition attempt, and allow for the continuance of normal app functioning. &#xd;
Newly-created space-data will automatically get picked up by the scheduled ({{{}Caesium{}}} - based) incremental/background indexer threads in due time, and there is no need to interrupt the normal processing of indexing lines and force an immediate/out-of-sequence index-flush.</description><createDate>2025-03-31T05:17:22.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 8.5.21.

&#xd;
Attaching a recording to help in the steps to reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
For reference you can increase verbose of the 2 modules below to DEBUG &#xd;
 * com.atlassian.confluence.user.crowd.UserIndexingListener - The event that should index users being synchronised&#xd;
 * com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations - The sender for the above event&#xd;
&#xd;
When the user is searchable we se the indexing event happening for adding the user to the group&#xd;
{code:java|title=atlassian-confluence-security.log}&#xd;
[...]&#xd;
[confluence.user.crowd.UserIndexingListener] onMembershipCreatedEvent test (GROUP_USER) added to confluence-users&#xd;
[...]&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
This log does not happen in the scenario above&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The *test* user having access to Confluence and being part of the *confluence-users* group should be indexed and searchable in *People Directory* (/)&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user is not displayed in the *People Directory* (x)&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Retriggering a synchronization of the Crowd User Directory could help but defeat the purpose of the feature that should indexed the new user "on the fly"&#xd;
 * Also when configuring *Update group memberships when logging in* is set to *Never* => the user index will happen during the synchronization and the user will be displayed. The customer is still pushing to have near instant display of the user in the People Directory as soon as they have valid access to Confluence.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Additional Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue has been fixed in Confluence LTS Branch 9.2 and this bug is here to ask for a backport of the fix to LTS Branch 8.5</description><createDate>2025-03-31T01:45:00.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>9.2: The create button is smaller now, unnamed for users with only view access in a space (including Anonymous).</summary><key>CONFSERVER-99505</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-99505</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
back port of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-96560&#xd;
&#xd;
The create button is smaller now, unnamed for either Anonymous users with view access and/or authenticated users with only view access in a space.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
h6. On Confluence&#xd;
 * Login as admin&#xd;
 * Go to General Configuration > Global Permissions > Edit Permissions and enable can use for Anonymous Access and save the changes. Alternatively, you can use an authenticated user who only has view access in a space.&#xd;
 * Go to any space and click on space tools&#xd;
 * Go to permissions and click on edit permissions&#xd;
 * For Anonymous Access deselect all the checkboxes and only keep the view selected and save the changes. Or, make sure the authenticated user you're testing with only has *view* access.&#xd;
&#xd;
h6. As an Anonymous user&#xd;
 * Now logout from Confluence and click on the Confluence logo at the top left corner&#xd;
After clicking you will land on #all-updates page&#xd;
 * Now go to any page from the space that we edited earlier providing view privileges for Anonymous Access&#xd;
 * It's observed that the create page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
&#xd;
h6. As an Authenticated user&#xd;
 * Now go to any page from the space that we edited earlier providing view privileges&#xd;
 * It's observed that the "Create" page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The create page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The create button should be visible as it used to be on Confluence v8.5.12&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using Jira Events in Team Calendar with large Jira instance linked, the dialog takes long time to load and eventually times out.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is caused by a bug reported in Jira Data Center: JSWSERVER-16764.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Establish a connection between Confluence DC and a large Jira DC via Application links.&#xd;
 ## As outlined in the relevant Jira ticket, the issue manifests for a significant number of projects, search filters, and custom date fields ({_}as these three data dimensions are queried{_}).&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Calendars section.&#xd;
 # Open the Add Event dialog.&#xd;
 # Choose one of the Jira event types: Jira Issue Dates, Jira Agile Sprints, or Jira Project Releases.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The dialog loads the form for the selected Jira Event Type, making it functional. Users can utilise it to create new events or edit existing ones.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2025-03-21-15-13-59-668.png|width=389,height=355!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The dialog is stuck in a loading state, ultimately resulting in a timeout that renders it unresponsive.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2025-03-21-15-13-31-074.png|width=390,height=357!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

!image-2025-03-18-16-07-51-997.png|width=478,height=490!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
On the "View page " page, the non-modal dialog that becomes available when the user mouse hovers over “user icon” is not accessible. These non-modal dialogs are coded inappropriately which makes functionality inaccessible for keyboard-only and screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The mentioned dialog should be accessible for keyboard-only and screen reader users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make the dialog accessible by performing the following steps:&#xd;
 # Ensure that both elements are accessible for all users, including those using screen readers and keyboard navigation.&#xd;
 # Implement the profile icon as a button that triggers a profile card popup; this can be achieved by adding role=”button” &#xd;
 # Add {{role="dialog"}} and {{"aria-labelledby"}} attribute to the {{&lt;div>}} element containing the modal dialog heading/title for text “User name”.&#xd;
 # Specify the "id" attribute with a unique value to the element containing the heading text i.e “User name” and reference it via the {{"aria-labelledby"}} attribute.&#xd;

&#xd;
Using a transformed plugin has been extremely dicey since the denylist changes were added in Confluence 8.8 and Confluence 9.0+, resulting in random footguns that pop up at random (such as this).

Hi all,&#xd;
&#xd;
The affected versions for this bug were previously listed incorrectly and we can confirm that only Confluence 9.3.2 is impacted. Those on Confluence 9.2 LTS or looking to upgrade to that version need not be concerned.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you are on earlier 9.x versions and still experiencing issues installing plugins - please reach out to the affected plugin developer(s) as such issues are unrelated to this bug.&#xd;
&#xd;
A fix for this bug will be available in Confluence 9.4.0.&#xd;
&#xd;
As one commenter has pointed out, this bug only impacts plugins which are "transformed". Plugin developers can fix this bug for customers immediately by updating their plugins to be "transformerless" and releasing a new version. This involves utilising the Atlassian Spring Scanner or the recommended [Spring Java configuration|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/spring-java-config/].&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
A Confluence instance with an Oracle or MSSQL DB backend fails to upgrade to listed affected Confluence versions if the label table has multiple rows of {{NULL}} names and {{NULL}} owners&#xd;
\\&#xd;
\\&#xd;
The upgrade will fail at executing schema modification operations triggered by the {{LabelUniqueIndexUpgradeTask}}, specifically the addition of a database-index named {{IDX_UNIQUE_LABEL_NAME_OWNER_NOT_NULL_NAMESPACE}} on that table.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) *Note*: Postgres and MySQL instances will let the upgrade succeed even in the presence of multiple {{NULL}} valued label-names and label-owners since {{NULL}} values are parsed/processed differently on those databases.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
On a Confluence 7.19.x or 8.5.x instance (with Oracle or MSSQL as the backend):&#xd;
Add bogus {{NULL}} value data to the {{label}} table like this (problematic values highlighted in red):&#xd;
||LABELID||NAME||OWNER||NAMESPACE||CREATIONDATE||LASTMODDATE||&#xd;
|720897|favourite|402894949583e753019583e843ac0000|my|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
|{color:#de350b}100{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|global|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
|{color:#de350b}200{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|global|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
|{color:#de350b}300{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|global|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
|{color:#de350b}400{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|global|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
|{color:#de350b}500{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|{color:#de350b}NULL{color}|global|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|2015-09-15 16:59:33.000|&#xd;
&#xd;
To check if the instance already has this kind of data, execute the following SQL:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT NAME, OWNER, NAMESPACE, COUNT(*)&#xd;
FROM LABEL&#xd;
WHERE NAME IS NULL AND OWNER IS NULL &#xd;
GROUP BY NAME, OWNER, NAMESPACE&#xd;
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
With this data, attempt upgrading the Confluence instance to listed affected versions.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The upgrade task should deal with duplicates in the {{label}} table by deleting/merging the relevant records.&#xd;
It should then successfully add the {{IDX_UNIQUE_LABEL_NAME_OWNER_NOT_NULL_NAMESPACE}} index to that table.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
While the upgrade task successfully deletes {{non-NULL}} duplicates, it leaves the {{NULL}} named, {{NULL}} owned rows untouched.&#xd;
Since those values remain undeleted, the subsequent attempt at adding the {{IDX_UNIQUE_LABEL_NAME_OWNER_NOT_NULL_NAMESPACE}} index to that table fails with an {{ORA-01452}} error.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
{{NULL}} valued label-names and label-owners represent invalid/corrupted data, and they (along with their references) should be removed from the database.&#xd;
&#xd;
Rollback the affected instance to the last stable pre-upgrade state/snapshot (i.e. Confluence Home, Shared Home and Install directories, as well as the DB).&#xd;
With Confluence now restored to the previous version snapshot, stop Confluence (if running), ensure that suitable database backups have been taken, and then execute the following SQL:&#xd;
# To find all rows in the {{label}} table with {{NULL}} valued label-names and label-owners, execute the following SQL:&#xd;
{code:sql|title=Query 1 - get all duplicated NULL-data}&#xd;
SELECT * FROM LABEL WHERE NAME IS NULL AND OWNER IS NULL ;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Note the {{labelid}} values here.&#xd;
\\&#xd;
\\&#xd;
# Using those {{labelid}} values, first delete any references in the {{content_label}} and, then the {{notifications}} tables:&#xd;
{code:sql|title=Query 2 - to delete references from the content_label table}&#xd;
DELETE FROM CONTENT_LABEL WHERE LABELID IN (SELECT LABELID FROM LABEL WHERE NAME IS NULL AND OWNER IS NULL);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
{code:sql|title=Query 3 - to delete references from the notifications table}&#xd;
DELETE FROM NOTIFICATIONS WHERE LABELID IN (SELECT LABELID FROM LABEL WHERE NAME IS NULL AND OWNER IS NULL);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
\\&#xd;
\\&#xd;
# With the foreign/child references thus deleted, the {{NULL}} value duplicates in the {{label}} table can then be deleted safely:&#xd;
{code:sql|title=Query 4 - to delete duplicates in the label table}&#xd;
DELETE FROM LABEL WHERE LABELID IN (SELECT LABELID FROM LABEL WHERE NAME IS NULL AND OWNER IS NULL);&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(i) *note*: all of the other {{non-NULL}} duplicate data will be addressed by the code in the upgrade task itself, manual-intervention is not necessary</description><createDate>2025-03-13T02:46:31.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 9.2.3.

A workaround is possible if we manually change the {{custom-css.vm}} file to prioritize *$style* attributes:&#xd;
 # Navigate to &lt;install-folder>/confluence/styles&#xd;
 # Move the "Custom styles" section in the file {{custom-css.vm}} so that it is above the "### CUSTOM SITE LOGOS", like this:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#disableAntiXss()&#xd;
&#xd;
## Custom styles for Confluence (included for all themes by default)&#xd;
$style&#xd;
## End custom styles for Confluence&#xd;
&#xd;
### CUSTOM SITE LOGOS &#xd;
.aui-header .aui-header-logo img {&#xd;
 content: var(--confluence-custom-logo-content); &#xd;
} &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 # Save this change and restart Confluence&#xd;
&#xd;
Please take note of this manual change to Confluence's install files. Until a fixed version is released, you will need to reapply this change every time you upgrade your Confluence instance.</description><createDate>2025-03-07T13:11:29.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I've been asked by Atlassian's Support to share the impact this bug has on us: we use {{@import}} in our global stylesheet because it consists of roughly 600 lines of instructions that change from time to time. As Confluence's stylesheet input area provides no versioning and there's next to no syntax highlighting, importing a text file that's attached to a Confluence page is a much better solution. The text file can be opened in Notepad++ via the Companion App, so we're benefitting from both Notepad++'s syntax highlighting and Confluence’s file versioning. This method also keeps space stylesheets neat and tidy, because if any special instructions are needed in a particular space in addition to the global instructions, then we only need to prepend them by a simple {{@import}} one-liner. Without the possibility to use {{{}@import{}}}, we would need to paste the global stylesheet to all those spaces manually every time the global stylesheet changes in any way. This would be very error-prone.</text><author>Martin Richter</author></comments><comments><text>Another workaround that worked for us which does not involve make changes to install files is to add this to the "HEAD" section of in the Custom HTML section of settings:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Task Report Macro not showing all tasks in Confluence when connected to MySQL database.&#xd;
&#xd;
Task Report Index is introduced in Confluence 8.7 which should index all task lists in Confluence to serve Task Report Macro.&#xd;
However, when Confluence is relying on Task Report Index in an instance connected to MySQL database, the Task Report Macro can be inaccurate when the total number of tasks in Confluence is more than 1000.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Confluence 9.1.0&#xd;
* MySQL 8.2&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
mysql> select VERSION();&#xd;
+-----------+&#xd;
| VERSION() |&#xd;
+-----------+&#xd;
| 8.2.0     |&#xd;
+-----------+&#xd;
1 row in set (0.00 sec)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
* Having more than 1000 task lists in {{*AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK*}} table&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
mysql> select count(*) from AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK;&#xd;
+----------+&#xd;
| count(*) |&#xd;
+----------+&#xd;
|   318019 |&#xd;
+----------+&#xd;
1 row in set (0.03 sec)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Install Confluence 9.1.0 and connect it with a supported MySQL version&#xd;
# Create more than 1000 Task Lists&#xd;
# Insert a Task Report Macro onto a page that is configured to show all tasks (which is more than 1000 that were created from the step above)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Task Report Macro shows all tasks that satisfy the macro condition&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Not all tasks that satisfy the macro condition is shown.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Diagnostic&#xd;
This is because a bug in the SQL query Confluence sends to MySQL fails to retrieve tasks after the _first iteration_ when building Task Report Index. The steps below can help to verify the issue:&#xd;
# Go to *General Configuration* > *Logging and Profiling*&#xd;
#* Search for {{*com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.tasklist.report.searchindex*}} and set it to *TRACE* level&#xd;
#* Scroll to the bottom and click *Save*&#xd;
# Go to *General Configuration* > *Content Indexing*&#xd;
#* Click *Rebuild* for *Site reindex* option, which will also trigger a rebuild for Task Report Index&#xd;
(!) Please note that rebuilding site index may take a long time depends on the size of Confluence. Only perform this in a non-production environment as diagnostic step&#xd;
# Pay attention to the {{atlassian-confluence.log}} with the logging below:&#xd;

(!) Notice that Confluence would only index the _first iteration_ where the default batch size is set to {{1000}}, and incorrectly report "_No more tasks were found_" on the next iteration despite there are more tasks in the database.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
As a workaround, customer can include a {{*Dark Feature*}} to force Confluence to always retrieve the Task Lists from the database instead of relying on the incorrect Task Report Index:&#xd;
# Go to the URL below with an admin account:&#xd;
#* &lt;BaseURL>/admin/darkfeatures.action&#xd;
# Scroll down to the *Site Dark Features* and enter the following feature in the empty field:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
confluence.task-report.use-database-for-reports&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
#* Click *Submit* &#xd;
&#xd;
(!) Once this issue is fixed in the future release, please manually remove the Dark Feature flag above to restore the usage of Task Report Index</description><createDate>2025-03-06T03:56:47.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This bug freaks all the users out since they lost all the Tasks after our Confluence 9.2.x upgrade.

Issue Summary&#xd;
On Confluence instances where _Collaborative Editing_ is turned off, editing or copying a Confluence page with an attachment triggers the execution of the following SQL via content-reconciliation threads:&#xd;
{code:sql|title=SQL seen executing against the bodycontent table if Confluence SQL logging is enabled, excerpt from atlassian-confluence-sql.log, formatted for easy reading}&#xd;
YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS,mmm DEBUG [reconciliation-executor:thread-6] [org.hibernate.SQL] logStatement &#xd;
select &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODYCONTENTID as bodycont1_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODY as body2_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.CONTENTID as contenti3_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODYTYPEID as bodytype4_13_ &#xd;
from &#xd;
	BODYCONTENT bodyconten0_ &#xd;
where &#xd;
	cast(contentId as varchar(255)) in (?)&#xd;
	-- comment: the "in" clause above will have one or more contentId values&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
In the SQL shown above, the "{{cast(contentId as varchar(255))}}" part in the {{where}} clause converts numeric Content IDs into {{varchar}} strings.&#xd;
This in turn ignores the already existing {{body_content_idx}} database-index defined on the {{bodycontent}} table's {{contentid}} column, since that database-index operates on a column having numeric values.&#xd;
Due to this absence of a suitable database-index for matching {{varchar}} casted numbers/contentIDs, a full scan of the {{bodycontent}} table becomes necessary, which can take time (multiple minutes) on large enough datasets.&#xd;
&#xd;
For comparison, the following SQL statement will be magnitudes faster (milliseconds level of execution time) since the existing {{body_content_idx}} database-index aids in findings the relevant row(s) faster:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
select &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODYCONTENTID as bodycont1_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODY as body2_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.CONTENTID as contenti3_13_, &#xd;
	bodyconten0_.BODYTYPEID as bodytype4_13_ &#xd;
from &#xd;
	BODYCONTENT bodyconten0_ &#xd;
where &#xd;
	contentId in (?)&#xd;
	-- comment: the "in" clause above will have one or more contentId values&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
On a Confluence 9.2.x or 9.1.x instance:&#xd;
 # navigate to *_Administration_* > *_General Configuration_* > {*}_Collaborative editing_{*}, under {*}_Editing mode_{*}, click *_Change mode_* and set it to *_Off_*&#xd;
 # (optional) to see the actual SQL causing suboptimal performance, either:&#xd;
 ** [enable SQL logging on Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf85/enabling-detailed-sql-logging-1283361534.html]&#xd;
(recommended only for brief intervals, use only during troubleshooting/investigation and turn off after the relevant data has been gathered), _OR_&#xd;
 ** obtain the slow-query logs/data from the database-server side (location/format varies based on the database vendor, please engage a Database Admin for this)&#xd;
 # create a new Confluence page, drag and drop an attachment on that page in the editor, save the page&#xd;
 ** this action should result in a {{reconciliation-executor}} thread (within Confluence) triggering the problematic SQL (example shown in the _Issue Summary_ section)&#xd;
 # (optional) the same reconciliation logic kicks in if this page is copied (with its attachment) to a different location in the page-hierarchy or another space on the instance&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Reconciliation threads should execute performant/optimized queries that use existing database-indexes for fast data retrieval.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Reconciliation threads end up casting numeric content IDs as {{varchar}} strings in the relevant SQL statements, which ignores the existing {{body_content_idx}} database-index defined on the {{bodycontent}} table's {{contentid}} column, resulting in significantly longer SQL execution times.&#xd;
&#xd;

Currently there is no known workaround for this behaviour. A workaround will be added here when available.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
This ticket is created from CONFSERVER-93635 as a continuation as it shares similar behavior that still impacts Confluence after it is closed as fixed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence is throwing errors about "CSSErrorListener" while a user is being *@ mentioned* on a page comment.&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite the error message, the notification will still manage to reach the recipient. However, since the error is thrown every time "NotificationSender" picks up a page, Confluence logs will get filled up with similar error messages quickly and create unnecessary noise.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) This issue is not replicable on version 8.5.X&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up Confluence 8.6.1&#xd;
 # Set up an SMTP mail server&#xd;
 # @ mention a user on a Page Comment that would trigger an email notification&#xd;
 ** The page can even be a blank page, or simply a page with 1 line of text.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Confluence will not return any error about the user mention.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Confluence returns errors about "CSSErrorListener" on the user mention action that would trigger an email notification.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The Atlassian Troubleshooting and Support Tools plugin fails to generate the support zip including the customizations when there are customizations in Confluence&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install a Confluence instance with version 9.2.1&#xd;
 # Check the ATST plugin version (if it is v2.3.0, please upgrade it to one of the versions 2.4.0, 2.5.1, and 2.6.0)&#xd;
 # Modify the Global layout &#xd;
 # Create the support zip with the customization option enabled&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is reproducible in Confluence v9.2.1 with ATST versions below:&#xd;
 * 2.4.0&#xd;
 * 2.5.1&#xd;
 * 2.6.0&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Downgrade the ATST plugin to v2.3.0</description><createDate>2025-02-14T09:06:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Thank you for working on this, and for finding a workaround.&#xd;
Unfortunately, after downgrading ATST plugin to v2.3.0, filenames in the support zip file (subdir: {{{}confluence-customisations/layouts/{}}}) are unrecognizable.&#xd;
&#xd;
I usually get filenames like this:&#xd;
 * customLayouts.txt&#xd;
 * Global customised layout - decorators-global.vmd&#xd;
 * Space XYZ customised layout - decorators-global.vmd&#xd;
 * ...&#xd;
&#xd;
With ATST 2.3.0 instead I get this list of files:&#xd;
 * comments.vmd&#xd;
 * comments.vmd0&#xd;
 * comments.vmd1&#xd;
 * comments.vmd2&#xd;
 * customLayouts.txt&#xd;
 * global.vmd&#xd;
 * global.vmd0&#xd;
 * global.vmd1&#xd;
 * global.vmd2&#xd;
 * global.vmd3&#xd;
 * main.vmd&#xd;
 * main.vmd0&#xd;
 * main.vmd1&#xd;
 * main.vmd2&#xd;
 * page.vmd&#xd;
 * page.vmd0&#xd;
 * page.vmd1&#xd;
&#xd;
Maybe this is caused by a difference I can see in the list of files stored in {{{}customLayouts.txt{}}}:&#xd;
 * _usually there is:_ Global customised layout - decorators{*}-{*}global.vmd&#xd;
 * _with ATST 9.3.0:_ Global customised layout - decorators{*}/{*}global.vmd&#xd;

You can use the 'theme.switcher.disable' dark feature to disable the Theme switcher and force Confluence to the Original Theme. However, the Original Theme is deprecated and this change will result in another bug: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-99182] </description><createDate>2025-02-12T20:25:24.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This affects version 9.2.2 as well.&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
As described in CONFSERVER-54048, confluence is using NVARCHAR2 instead of VARCHAR2 as default char set since 5.9. So one possible way is to update all columns that still using `VARCHAR2` to `NVARCHAR2`&#xd;
&#xd;
It is recommended to contact support to evaluate this approach before doing any column type changes. So you do backup and also understand the effort it will cost based on your db size as it may take very long time to execute.&#xd;

&#xd;
If you have already successfully upgraded to 9.2.2, it means the label unique index upgrade task executed successfully on your instance. (You can check database `LABEL` table and verify if index `IDX_UNIQUE_LABEL_NAME_OWNER_NOT_NULL_NAMESPACE` is created). And you *CAN* do a normal upgrade from 9.2.2 to 9.2.3. Thanks.</text><author>Jeffery Xie</author></comments><comments><text>Hi [~addafc83baca] ,&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue does not affect the way of your upgrade. You can always plan the upgrade on your dev env first to ensure it works. While before you upgrade, be aware of the [major changes of difference version|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf92/confluence-upgrade-matrix-1477577572.html] and the [supported platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf92/supported-platforms-1477577494.html] and use the upgrade plan tool to evaluate the requirements. &#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
Thanks for the information. It does looks strange. As from the logs, it can be confirmed that it try to create the new column with `VARCHAR2(255)` which should be same column type as `OWNER` column. I guess if there is any corrupted data in your `OWNER` column, so issue happens when copy the value to `OWNER_NOT_NULL`.&#xd;
&#xd;
Can I kindly ask you to raise a support ticket, so they can help you analysis the root cause of the problem.

Problem&#xd;
In Confluence 8.5.x, personal spaces for users with spaces in their usernames (e.g., ~test 4) worked correctly. However, after upgrading to Confluence 9.1 and onwards, personal spaces for these users fail to load.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although *Confluence does not allow creating usernames with spaces* manually, it does not block usernames with spaces when they are synced from LDAP or Active Directory. In 9.1 onward versions, these users can still log in, but their personal spaces can't be accessed or created.&#xd;

# Deploy a vanilla Confluence 9.2 instance.&#xd;
# Create a new user in the instance with a blank space in its name (this user needs to be either synced from an external directory or created via JIT).&#xd;

The personal space should load/create successfully for external users with spaces in their usernames, just like in Confluence 8.5.x.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When Confluence is integrated with other application, the *Application Navigator's* icon appears in the top bar. &#xd;
&#xd;
When the global colour scheme is customised and a color is set for Header items, it applies to all menu items but does not apply the color to the icon of the Application Navigator's icon, the icon stays in dark blue.&#xd;
&#xd;
This can result in visibility issue when the background of the header is set to a dark color.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Integrate another app (e.g. Jira) with Confluence to enable the Application Navigator icon&#xd;
 # Go to *Global Color Scheme* from Administration&#xd;
 # Change the *Header* to #222 and change *Header Items* to YELLOW >> Save&#xd;
 # Go to the dashboard, the icon of the Application Navigator is not visible &#xd;
 # Changing the color of any Element under Color Scheme does not change the color of the Application Navigator icon&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The color of the Application Navigator's icon should follow the same color specified for *Header items* in Global Color Scheme&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
When setting permissions in Team Calendar, external group names containing a comma (",") are not processed correctly. Instead of being recognized as a single group, the system splits the name into multiple parts, causing permission assignment issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Confluence DC bundled Team Calendar&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Set up an external user management system such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.&#xd;
# Sync an external group that contains a comma (",") in its name (e.g., "Engineering, DevOps").&#xd;
# Navigate to the Team Calendar permission setting page in Confluence.&#xd;
# Click on the *Group Search* button to add a group.&#xd;
# Search for and select the synced external group with a comma or slash in its name.&#xd;
# Confirm the addition of the group.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The group should be added as a single entity, with its full name preserved.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The group name is split into multiple separate entries, breaking the permission assignment.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When using the Jira Issue/Filter Macro on a Confluence page, the Epic Links are rendered in colors that match the background, making the text unreadable. This issue is observed when displaying the Epic Link column and affects visibility due to color rendering issues. It appears to be related to changes introduced with the "Dark Mode" feature, first released in Confluence 9.0, although it occurs regardless of whether dark mode is enabled. Notably, the issue is not reproducible in earlier versions such as Confluence 8.7 and 8.9, supporting the hypothesis that the problem is associated with the Dark Mode feature introduced in Confluence 9.0.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Confluence page and insert a Jira Issue/Filter Macro.&#xd;
 # Configure the macro to display the Epic Link column.&#xd;
 # Save the page. &#xd;
 # Confirm that the Epic Link column appears empty.&#xd;

{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Epic Links should be clearly visible against the background, regardless of the color theme or mode used. For example, in an ideal scenario, the epic would be displayed in the preview, and the link would be easily readable without needing to highlight the text.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Epic Links are rendered in colors that match the background, making them unreadable. The text in the Epic Link column appears empty until highlighted, revealing a visibility issue with the current color scheme. This indicates a rendering issue where the text color is not appropriately adjusted for visibility against the background.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # In Jira, navigate to the main issue of the affected epic.&#xd;
 # Click on *Admin* > {*}Add field{*}, and look for the *Epic Colour* field.&#xd;
 # This field will contain a value in the format {{{}ghx-label-##{}}}. Empty this field and save the changes.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
(!)  {*}Note{*}: Modifying the Epic Colour will alter how Jira users see the epic's visual representation in the user interface.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Enabling *Maintenance Mode* + *Recovery Mode* (as described in [Restore Passwords to Recover Admin User Rights|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/restore-passwords-to-recover-admin-user-rights-158390.html] results in all login attempts failing, including those for the Recovery Admin user. The error displayed is:&#xd;
"{_}Something went wrong. Refresh the page and try again{_}."&#xd;
This effectively makes Confluence entirely inaccessible.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Enable *Maintenance Mode* in Confluence.&#xd;
 # Enable *Recovery Mode* by setting the required property in _confluence.cfg.xml_ as per [Atlassian's recovery guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/restore-passwords-to-recover-admin-user-rights-158390.html].&#xd;
 # *Restart* Confluence.&#xd;
 # Attempt to log in using the Recovery Admin or any other user (admin or non-admin).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * The generated Recovery Admin user should be able to log in to perform administrative actions.&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
*Disable Maintenance Mode and restore access (Outside the UI):*&#xd;
*Option 1*:&#xd;
# Modify the _confluence.cfg.xml_ file in the Shared Home directory:&#xd;
## *From*: &lt;property name="access.mode">*READ_ONLY*&lt;/property>&#xd;
## *To*: &lt;property name="access.mode">*READ_WRITE*&lt;/property>&#xd;
# *Restart* Confluence.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Option 2* (Database) - *+Take a backup before any modifications+*:&#xd;
# Run the following SQL query:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT * &#xd;
FROM BANDANA &#xd;
WHERE BANDANACONTEXT = '_GLOBAL' &#xd;

!Screenshot 2024-11-20 at 4.17.26 PM.png|width=211,height=118!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When low vision users view the page after zooming in, some content in the main content area is not available. For e.g. after zooming in to 200%, the content such as "There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world." become unavailable.&#xd;
As a result, this made it difficult for low vision users to access the page content and functionality.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The page content and functionality should be available even when the page is zoomed upto 200%.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the page content is displayed using relative units for text and container so that users can access the page with zoom settings turned on. At the minimum, the page layouts should support up to 200% zoom.&#xd;

&#xd;
The "Comment" &amp; "Like"  lacks role img &amp; textual description. Screen readers will announce these buttons as "Unlabelled". As a result, screen reader users will be unable to identify the purpose of these images.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen readers should announce the textual description of these image buttons that describes its purpose for the users.&#xd;
Apply the following changes: &#xd;
 * Define the image using role="img"&#xd;
 * Ensure that appropriate textual description for the images is provided and it completely describes the purpose of these images.Use the "aria-label" attribute on the img element to provide a textual description&#xd;

&#xd;
ARIA role should be appropriately used with correct semantics and its unnecessary usage should be avoided.&#xd;
&#xd;
Remove role="Button" from the "anchor" element in the page source.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The reading order of the content of the page is inaccurate as it does not follow a logical order.&#xd;
For instance, screen reader read the content in the following order of the page:&#xd;
1. "All Day" &amp; so on content present in list markup&#xd;
2. "Today"  text&#xd;
3. "Date" such as 06 Nov&#xd;
 &#xd;
This inaccurate reading order will create confusion for screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen reader should read the content in the correct logical order for its users.&#xd;
Place the content of webpages in correct meaningful sequence in the source code. Move the content in the page source in the below mentioned order. CSS can be used to maintain the presentation of the page.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Correct Reading order should be:&#xd;
1. "Date" such as 06 Nov&#xd;
2. "Today"  text&#xd;
3. "All Day" &amp; so on content present in list markup&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the “Cancel” button is activated to dismiss the dialog (which appears on activating more actions), the focus does not return to the triggering element. Instead, it moves to the container of the page &amp; on tabbing it comes back to the "next" interactive element.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, keyboard only and screen reader users will have to navigate the screen content again before accessing the content which is after the triggering button.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the user saves the comment, the keyboard focus should move to the triggering element.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the keyboard focus moves the triggering element when the modal dialog is closed which can be achieved via JavaScript focus() method.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
On activating the “Delete” button, the status message “Deleted” gets dynamically added to the page. The dynamically added message is not defined programmatically.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are not aware of the message being displayed on the page.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Screen reader should announce the dynamically added status message for their users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the ARIA live region to make sure that the dynamic update is announced for screen reader users. This can be achieved by either adding a live region role="status" or aria-live="polite" and aria-atomic="true" attributes to the container used to display the message. Make sure the live region is present in the page source by default.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When Collaborative editing is enabled and Java is updated from version 11 to 17 or 17 is in use, users couldn't edit any pages because of errors in Synchrony. It only happens when */tmp* directory is mounted as {*}noexec{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue is caused by [bug|https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/348] *org.xerial.snappy:snappy-java* library, which explains why issue happens - snappy tries to use reflection on private field *{{address}}* from *{{java.nio.Buffer}}* class (see this [line|https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/snappy-1.1.8/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/pure/UnsafeUtil.java#L44] in version 1.1.8). Starting form java 16 (see [https://openjdk.org/jeps/396]), all internal elements are strongly encapsulated, so classes which are not part of the JDK shouldn’t have access to them anymore. This bug was fixed in later versions of snappy library (see release notes for [v1.1.9.0|https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/releases/tag/v1.1.9.0]), but unfortunately synchrony continue to use version 1.1.8.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
*Option:1*&#xd;
 # Install Confluence 8.5.12 with Java 11.&#xd;
 # Make sure that the /tmp directory is noexec.&#xd;
 # Use another temp directory by using *-Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/atlassian/tmp* parameter for Confluence.&#xd;
 # Create and edit pages and verify that it is successful.&#xd;
 # Then change the Java version to 17.&#xd;
 # Restart Confluence.&#xd;
 # Create and edit pages and check that it is failing.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Option:2*&#xd;
 # Install a fresh Confluence with Java 17 bundled.&#xd;
 # Make sure that the /tmp directory is noexec.&#xd;
 # Use another temp directory by using *-Djava.io.tmpdir=/var/atlassian/tmp* parameter for Confluence.&#xd;
 # Create and edit pages and check that it is failing.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Collaborative editing continue to work as usual.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the atlassian-synchrony.log file:&#xd;

&#xd;
[^Screen Recording 2024-11-05 at 8.42.43 AM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The programmatic focus remains on the triggering element itself when the "{*}Delete{*}" dialog appears. Even though non- modal dialog is visible on the screen,content is available at the end of the page for keyboard-only and screen reader users. This required screen reader users and keyboard-only users to tab pass the content on the page before they can interact with the modal dialog.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The programmatic focus should be set on the first logical element of the dialog as soon as dialog appears.&#xd;
&#xd;
Set the keyboard focus to the first logical element such as "Delete" dialog title of the modal dialog in this case using the javascript .focus().&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Link is not distinguishable when compared to surrounding text.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:*  This issue is globally present on the footer area of the pages.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the "Confluence DC" page.&#xd;
 # Navigate to footer section via TAB key.&#xd;
 # Observe that link such as “Atlassian Confluence” and so on links is not distinguishable when compared to surrounding text.&#xd;

h3. Screenshot&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2024-10-30-17-11-02-780.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Color alone is used to distinguish the “Atlassian Confluence” and so on links from surrounding text, underlines are visible only on mouse hover. Even though sufficient color contrast is provided the links do not have persistent underlines making it difficult for users with color blindness and mobility impairment to distinguish the link within the text.&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure to provide underlining for link text even when the keyboard focus is not on the interactive element. This will make sure that users can differentiate between links and text.&#xd;
&#xd;
Provide the following CSS properties to links:&#xd;
 {{text-decoration: underline;}}&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The link text "Open" does not describe the destination it points to.&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users might not understand the purpose of the link effectively.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the link text should be meaningful and unique so that users of a screen reader comprehends the link’s purpose clearly. In this scenario, provide a complete and descriptive textual description as “Open Comment” for the mentioned link via hidden text.&#xd;
&#xd;
If the above solution is not feasible, use “aria-label” attribute to manually provide a complete and descriptive textual description for the link. Make sure that the “aria-label” attribute value clearly indicates the purpose of the link.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note: Before implementing hidden text/accessible name for the mentioned link. Kindly consult with the content design team for suggestion/approval.*&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a External directory/ Edit an Internal directory (mark editable = true in atlassian-plugin : ref pr: https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFSERVER/repos/confluence/pull-requests/34529/overview&#xd;
 # In the Edit view you will be able to "Enable Nested Groups" &#xd;
!https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/TE8HJA7RS-F07SF3S0PA8-3c1cb65b9a/image_720.png!&#xd;
 # With this you should be able to add a "Group" inside another Group.&#xd;
 # In the Group search bar for Add member, searching for a group should result in finding the group with the feature enabled.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
1. We should be able to search other groups in the Add member search bar in Group edit page.&#xd;
2. The group to be added once found should be able to be added in the Parent Group&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
We are not able to search for the group and hence not able to add it.{noformat}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
For Internal Directory: disable the "Edit" functionality, sample pr: [https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFSERVER/repos/confluence/pull-requests/34529/overview]&#xd;
&#xd;
For external directory there is no workaround.</description><createDate>2024-10-22T12:33:36.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>hi [@jhronik|https://atlassian.slack.com/team/WEKG31L4B] ,&#xd;
So Nested groups is not supported at all in confluence from the prerspective that you can have a Group inside a Group .The behaviour for different directories is different though : # Internal Directories: For internal directories this is not supported at all, but shows up as an option when the edit button is enabled for the directory&#xd;
 # External Directories: You can create nested groups in external directories, but in confluence you need to enable the nested group flag, and the behavior changes as follows:&#xd;
 ## If flag is turned off: You will not be able to see any nested group or group members in the Group users list.&#xd;
 ## If flag is turned on to enable nested groups :  You will be able to see all the users present in the nested group flattened in the group members page&#xd;
&#xd;
I have recorded the behavboir for external directories here: [https://www.loom.com/share/3f5921ab89b94ae3b018277db0ad531f] &#xd;
for more refernece you can check the thread: [https://atlassian.slack.com/archives/CFGBMQD6D/p1729667137716719]&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Essentially there are two problems: &#xd;
1. For Internal Directory: When the edit button is enabled and clicked in directory setup page, the ui shows an option to "Enable Nested Groups" , but since internal directories dont support this we need to remove that option in "Edit" mode.&#xd;
2. For external directory: The group page where you can see all members does not show the "nested-groups" like visible in external sites like azure, it shows a flattened list of users.&#xd;

&#xd;
 The focus does not move to the first interactive element of the “Share this page" dialog in the main content area.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the “Confluence DC” page.&#xd;
 # Navigate onto the “Share” button and activate it.&#xd;
 # A dialog will appear over the screen.&#xd;
 # Observe that keyboard focus is moving to “Copy” button instead of first interactive element of the dialog.&#xd;

h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
As soon as the “Share this page" dialog appear on the page, the focus moves inappropriately to the "Copy” button instead of the first interactive element of the dialog.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, it will create a poor experience for the screen reader and keyboard-only users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that when the user activates the "Share" button, the focus should goes first interactive element such as "Share link" form field. This can be achieved via the JavaScript.focus() method.&#xd;

&#xd;
[^Screen Recording 2024-10-22 at 4.51.23 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Focus is not visible for the “Names” , "Remarks" and so on column headers in the main content area. A focus indicator is not visually available as the user tabs through these controls using a keyboard.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, users with learning and mobility impairments as well as those with low vision will not be able to easily find out which element currently has the focus.&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Focus indicator should be clearly visible while navigating the mentioned elements using a keyboard.&#xd;
&#xd;
Provide a clear visual indication display a blinking vertical bar (all four sides) for interactive elements when user navigates via TAB key.&#xd;

[^Screen Recording 2024-10-21 at 7.20.04 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
When the "Watch page" and "Watch all content in this space" checkboxes are activated the focus is not visible any where on the page. In fact, the focus becomes visible on the next interactive element such as "Manage watchers" button when users press tab once. This illogical focus order might make the page difficult to understand for the keyboard and screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. ExpectedResult&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the focus is managed appropriately when the checkboxes are selected/unselected.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this scenario, when the user select/unselect the mentioned checkboxes, the focus should be visible on checkboxes. This can be done with the “focus” method. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
On the "Calendar" page the content is not available on browser's zoom functionality at 200%.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Open confluence dc test env URL-https://instenv-370431-8mbh.instenv.internal.atlassian.com/calendar/mycalendar.action&#xd;
# Navigate to "Calendar" in the header section&#xd;
# Navigate to the main content area.&#xd;
# Follow below steps for browser's zoom functionality →&#xd;
* Go to Chrome settings&#xd;
* Zoom&#xd;
* Set zoom to 200%.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Screenshot&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Actual Results&#xd;
When a low vision user magnifies the page using the browser's zoom functionality (at 200% zoom), the "Subscribe" button overlaps with the "Timeline" button, causing accessibility issues.As a result, this made it difficult for low vision users to access the page content and functionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3.Expected Results&#xd;
Ensure that all the page content is visible when zoomed in. Use relative units to define font and container sizes in CSS to ensure that page's content reflows correctly when zoomed in. Flexible layouts should be used to display the page content. Dimensions for container elements used to display the page content should be defined using relative units, such as "%", "em", "rem" etc. to ensure that the content fits on the page when zoomed in.&#xd;

h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
The aria-current attribute for mentioned link is incorrectly defined on the &lt;li> element instead of &lt;a> element that containing "pages" text. As a result, screen reader users are communicated with inappropriate information.&#xd;

h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Inappropriate and verbose accessible name such as "Expand item Getting started" is provided for "Getting started" button. The expand/collapse state information already conveyed via aria expanded attribute . As a result . This dual and verbose information will confuse or misleads about the button state functionality and resulting in difficultly to understand the button state effectively&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the buttons label should be appropriate and clear.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this scenario, as the buttons state is conveyed through expanded attribute. Hence we would recommend to you keep the accessible name as “Getting started” constantly.&#xd;

h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
The "2024“ , "October" buttons in the "Blog" section are not focusable with a keyboard. The role of button is not programmatically determined for screen reader users. This made it difficult for keyboard-only and screen reader users to access the functionality associated with the mentioned button.&#xd;
h3. Expected Result&#xd;
&#xd;
The button should be focusable and operable with a keyboard and have a programmatically defined button role.&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that all the interactive elements are focusable and operable using a keyboard and screen reader.&#xd;
*Apply the following changes:*&#xd;
 *  Code the mentioned buttons using {{&lt;button>}} tag or {{role="button"}} and {{{}tabindex="0"{}}}.&#xd;
 * Remove the {{aria-expanded}} attribute from the {{&lt;li>}} element.&#xd;
 * Provide the state of the button using the {{aria-expanded}} attribute to &lt;button>. Also, update the “true” and “false” values appropriately. The value should be set to “true” when the button is expanded and “false” when the button is collapsed.&#xd;
 * Modify the scripts to ensure the button is operable with a keyboard.&#xd;

 # _ContentPropertyIndexSchema_ will register plugin index schema with the mapping by types as:&#xd;
 ## extract path with type date -> *DateFieldMapping*&#xd;
 ## extract path with type number -> *LongFieldMapping*&#xd;
 # _ContentPropertiesExtractor_ will call _ContentPropertyExtractionManagerImpl_ to extract and mapping stored property jsonString with schemaFields as:&#xd;
 ## DateFieldTransformation -> return *StringFieldDescriptor* with *StringFieldMapping*&#xd;
 ## NumberFieldTransformation -> return *DoubleFieldDescriptor* with *DoubleFieldMapping*&#xd;
 # Then it tries to adding the field mapping from step 2 by comparing with the registered ones from step 1. It throws warnings of mapping types conflicts. As we have:&#xd;
 ## *DateFieldMapping*  vs *StringFieldMapping*&#xd;
 ## *LongFieldMapping*  vs *DoubleFieldMapping*&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
According to [the dev doc|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/content-properties-in-the-rest-api/#supported-index-field-types], it says type number will be indexed as double, and date can be represented as either String or long, so the above mappings are neither correct in both step 1 and 2.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h2. Summary&#xd;
 # There is no workaround as it requires code changes in confluence to fix this issue. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Confluence space is favourited by a large number of users, this causes severe latency issues when loading any Confluence page within that space and likely other pages related to that space.&#xd;
&#xd;
The exact number of favouritings required to trigger a noticeable increase in latency is not reliably known. It is likely environment and instance activity dependent. It also likely requires the surpassing of the Hibernate L2 cache limits. One large customer observed that a space with roughly 4000 user favourites was seeing Confluence page load times upwards of 10 seconds.&#xd;
&#xd;
The root cause for this issue is the lack of usage of specialised label SQL queries. Whenever a label related operation is performed, all labellings for that entity are retrieved, including all personal labels for all users on that instance. This issue is not limited to just space entities, but this is where it may be more apparent due to the increased likelihood of a large number of user favouritings on a popular space. The current query approach is not scalable with instance user quantity.&#xd;
&#xd;
The retrieval of all space labels on the view of any Confluence page in that space is currently triggered by the code com.atlassian.confluence.userstatus.DefaultFavouriteManager#isUserFavourite(com.atlassian.user.User, com.atlassian.confluence.spaces.Space). Removing or optimising this specific call should provide immediate relief to affected instances.&#xd;
&#xd;
To rectify and prevent potential related issues, and ensure Confluence remains scalable into the future, the com.atlassian.confluence.core.AbstractLabelableEntityObject should be reworked so that personal labels are not fetched from the database by default.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
To more easily reproduce this without needing to surpass caching limits, you may disable Hibernate L2 caching by making the following edits in databaseSubsystemContext.xml (Confluence &lt;8.6) or productionDatabaseContext.xml otherwise.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;prop key="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">false&lt;/prop>&#xd;
&lt;prop key="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">false&lt;/prop> {code}&#xd;
 # Create a Space and a page within that Space&#xd;
 # Have multiple users log in and favourite that Space&#xd;
 # Log in as an administrator&#xd;
 # Enable SQL logging at /admin/viewlog4j.action&#xd;
 # Browse to the page within that Space&#xd;
 # Observe the SQL log files&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Personal labels for users other than the authenticated user are not retrieved from the database.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Excessive number of label SQL queries, such as the following.&#xd;

The problem we stumbled across is that at some point the rendering of the special chars works, which leads to inconsitencies in data, thus rendering the charts useless, as they cannot be displayed correctly.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence's incremental/background indexing can occasionally come under some processing load while attempting to flush newly indexed data. This is visible as slowly increasing _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR {_}Change queue{_}. This is normal, and is something that Confluence generally overcomes on its own (given enough time, and a sufficiently suitable dip in content-creation/modification rates). &#xd;
&#xd;
{_}However{_}, if a user attempts creating a _Personal space_ in that same timeframe, the sequence of events involved while executing the {{/create-personal-space}} action also include an _immediate_ index-queue flush operation. The index-queue flush operation involves acquiring a lock on the desired index before data is written/committed to it. With incremental/background indexing already in progress (and occasionally stressed with a few pending objects to index), the {{/create-personal-space}} action can end up waiting indefinitely for a lock to execute its own one-time index-queue flush. &#xd;
&#xd;
The situation can worsen if a few more users attempt the creation of their own _Personal spaces_ in that same timeframe. Then, each {{/create-personal-space}} action will attempt executing its own one-time index-queue flush, going through the same motions of waiting to lock the desired index while other threads are still flushing/committing data to that same index.&#xd;
This sub-optimal lock-acquisition behavior then results in bringing down the overall indexing rates, which in turn show up as:&#xd;
 - constantly high (hundreds of thousands) _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR _Change queue_&#xd;
 - inaccurate search results (newly created/modified Confluence content is not yet searchable)&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
(Similar to [CONFSERVER-90319|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-90319])&#xd;
 # Setup a Confluence instance and try to push a lot of content (create new pages, comments etc.) using any kind of automation (plugins or REST API scripts).&#xd;
 # Ensure that the _Queued for processing_ numbers under _Administration_ > _Content Indexing_ > _Content queue_ OR _Change queue_ are in the thousands.&#xd;
 # Attempt creating a new _Personal space_ via _Spaces_ > _Create space_&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Provided that a _Personal space_ does not already exist for the user account in question, a new _Personal space_ should be created in a matter of a few seconds.&#xd;
Once created, content posted to that space should be searchable after a reasonable time (generally a few minutes) once the existing backlog of pending items have been indexed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The _Personal space_ creation action executes an immediate one-time index-queue flush, which in turns waits for the acquisition of a lock. &#xd;
Add a few more concurrent _Personal space_ creation actions, along with a sufficiently large and active indexing backlog, and the incremental/background indexing pace will slow down to a crawl from adhering to lock re-acquisition routines.&#xd;
&#xd;
The runtime of the http thread that triggered the _Personal space_ creation may eventually exceed Tomcat's {{StuckThreadDetectionValve}} default threshold of 60 seconds. &#xd;
That will show up in the instance's {{&lt;confluence-install-dir>/logs/catalina.*}} log:&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
[Set|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-system-properties-168002854.html] the following system property to control/specify the amount of time (in minutes) that a Confluence thread may wait for, in order to acquire a lock on a desired index:&#xd;
{code:bash}&#xd;
-Dconfluence.index.manager.lock.timeout=1&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
This will permit contending threads to timeout a lock-acquisition attempt, and allow for the continuance of normal app functioning. &#xd;
Newly-created space-data will automatically get picked up by the scheduled ({{Caesium}} - based) incremental/background indexer threads in due time, and there is no need to interrupt the normal processing of indexing lines and force an immediate/out-of-sequence index-flush.</description><createDate>2024-08-01T12:44:52.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 8.5.19. [Upgrade|https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives?utm_source=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_campaign=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_medium=email] now or check out the [Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+8.5+Release+Notes?utm_source=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_campaign=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_medium=email] to see what other issues are resolved.</text><author>Garvit Sharma</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 9.2.1. [Upgrade|https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives?utm_source=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_campaign=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_medium=email] now or check out the [Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+9.2+Release+Notes?utm_source=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_campaign=confluence_bugfix&amp;utm_medium=email] to see what other issues are resolved.</text><author>Garvit Sharma</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 9.3.1.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The create button is smaller now, unnamed for either Anonymous users with view access and/or authenticated users with only view access in a space.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes) &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
h6. On Confluence &#xd;
* Login as admin&#xd;
* Go to General Configuration > Global Permissions > Edit Permissions and enable can use for Anonymous Access and save the changes.  Alternatively, you can use an authenticated user who only has view access in a space.&#xd;
* Go to any space and click on space tools&#xd;
* Go to permissions and click on edit permissions&#xd;
* For Anonymous Access deselect all the checkboxes and only keep the view selected and save the changes.  Or, make sure the authenticated user you're testing with only has *view* access.&#xd;
&#xd;
h6. As an Anonymous user &#xd;
* Now logout from Confluence and click on the Confluence logo at the top left corner &#xd;
After clicking you will land on #all-updates page&#xd;
* Now go to any page from the space that we edited earlier providing view privileges for Anonymous Access&#xd;
* It's observed that the create page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
&#xd;
h6. As an Authenticated user &#xd;
* Now go to any page from the space that we edited earlier providing view privileges&#xd;
* It's observed that the "Create" page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The create page button just becomes a dark blue square box and there is nothing mentioned on the box unless we click on the box&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The create button should be visible as it used to be on Confluence v8.5.12&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available</description><createDate>2024-07-24T13:43:41.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The issue is r{*}eproduced for any user (not only anonymous){*} in the next scenario:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Flush Edge Index Queue Job transaction runs for several days and so edge index processing is halted. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create few large page trees under Confluence(Eg 5 large page trees with 10K child pages each)&#xd;
 # Change the permissions across these parent pages and toggle these few times. Try out 10 different iterations. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Flush Edge Index Queue Job queues these changes and processes them in batches one by one.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Flush Edge Index Queue Job pushes these changes to the same session time and again causing the entities managed by hibernate session to grow. If the sessions entities grew really large in small amount of time, this can cause recursive behaviour(hibernate dirty check mechanism which would walk through each entity) where the transaction would never complete and so this directly impacts edge index processing under Confluence. In this specific case, we could see hibernate was trying to work with 1,090,303 entityEntries as a part of [flushEntities method|https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/main/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/event/internal/AbstractFlushingEventListener.java] based on heap dumps. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
 Copy indexes from the working node manually.  </description><createDate>2024-06-13T16:02:28.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Reindex throws an error: 1000 sub pages: ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000</summary><key>CONFSERVER-95968</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-95968</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
h4. *For Scenario 2* - when the number of ancestor pages exceeds 1000.&#xd;
&#xd;
Check whether the following JVM flags are present with high values:&#xd;

-Dconfluence.reindex.documents.to.pop (Default value is 10)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
If the above JVM flags are present, try lowering the custom assigned value or deleting the JVM flag to revert to default values.</description><createDate>2024-06-12T03:17:57.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>we are in 8.5.19, we are effected with this bug. over 19k parent pages with more than 1k child pages. splitting manually its not possible. can we get a patch for this please?</text><author>Subramanyam Aregala</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Clicking "Create blog post" from "Blog posts" macro results in error</summary><key>CONFSERVER-95894</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-95894</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Is there a way to deactivate the atl_token or to include it in the URL for your own links?</text><author>Dennis Nickel</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,&#xd;
&#xd;
I am having this same issue. When I click to add a blog post the URL does not include the &amp;alt_token at all.  If I add "&amp;alt_token=......." to the end, then it allows me to add a new blog post. &#xd;

&#xd;
Dynamically updating the slides is not communicated with screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the homepage.&#xd;
 # Kindly log in with the credentials&#xd;
 # Observe that a "Check out what's changed in Confluence" modal dialog appears on the page.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the carousel present in the dialog.&#xd;
 # Listen that the region consisting of a carousel is not identified.&#xd;
 # Activate the carousel controls.&#xd;
 # Observe that slides in the carousel change but this is not announced.&#xd;

&#xd;
[^Screen Recording 2024-05-22 at 4.26.08 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
On activating the carousel controls, the content of the respective slide gets dynamically updated. Although the dynamic change in the content is easier to understand for sighted users, it is not intuitive for screen reader users. Moreover, the region consisting of the carousel is not programmatically determined. As a result, screen reader users will not be able to identify the presence of the carousel and find it difficult to understand the behaviour.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The region consisting of the carousel should be identified with a screen reader. Also, the screen reader should announce the change of slides when users activate the carousel controls.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Apply the following changes :&#xd;
• Add role "region" and aria-label="Carousel" attribute to the &lt;div> element containing the carousel content.&#xd;
• Add role="status" to the &lt;div> tag containing the carousel content to ensure that the screen reader announces the updated content.&#xd;
 &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After changing the title of a page with many incoming links, saving is very slow.&#xd;
By my test it takes over 1 minute, if there 1000 pages have links to the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
By the report from customer, it will take over 4 mins to get page saved. Especially, when timeout happens, it is hard for customer to know if the page saved or not.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When inserting a link from the editor toolbar -> “Insert More Content” -> “Link”, the search options are not announced for the screen reader users when user press up/down arrow keys to navigate.&#xd;
&#xd;
This makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand the options.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When user type in the mentioned input fields the search results/Suggestions should announced for the screen reader users when user press up/down arrow keys.&#xd;
&#xd;
We can achieve this by modifying it as editable combobox.&#xd;
 * Provide role combobox and other aria attributes to the input field.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Provide role listbox to the list of options and associate them to this input field using appropriate aria attributes.&#xd;
&#xd;
For more information on implementation, refer to the following link: [!https://www.w3.org/favicon.ico!Editable Combobox With List Autocomplete Example|https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-autocomplete-list/]&#xd;

&#xd;
Observation: The list of suggested links that appears on typing any character in the "Search" input field are still not declared as an editable combobox.&#xd;
&#xd;
The best possible solution in this scenario would be to refactor this component into an editable combobox. &#xd;
&#xd;
On the combobox, use role="combobox". Where possible, expand a native &lt;input>. Make sure that the &lt;input> is labelled. This can be done with &lt;label> or aria-labelledby. Use aria-expanded to differentiate when the listbox is expanded and collapsed. As well, use aria-activedescendant to programmatically determine the active option. This attribute uses the id of the active option. On the listbox, use role="listbox". Where possible, expand a list container such as &lt;ul>. On the options, use role="option". Where possible, expand &lt;li>. As well, use aria-selected to differentiate of the active and inactive options.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the component can be controlled with a keyboard. The standard approach is that users tab onto the combobox and use Arrow Keys to adjust the listbox. This can be done in parallel with the aforementioned aria-activedescendant and aria-selected.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
Entering "465" for mail server port does not enable SMTPS configurations. This issue didn't exist in 7.19.x&#xd;
&#xd;
The mail server properties in the bandana table show the following which is not correct:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
 &lt;name>Mail Server&lt;/name>&#xd;
          &lt;password>0000000&lt;/password>&#xd;
          &lt;port>465&lt;/port>&#xd;
          &lt;props>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.debug" value="false"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.transport.protocol" value="smtp"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.port" value="465"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.quitwait" value="false"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.null.auth" value="false"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.timeout" value="10000"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.auth" value="true"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.starttls.enable" value="true"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.host" value="host_address"/>&#xd;
            &lt;property name="mail.smtp.connectiontimeout" value="10000"/>&#xd;
          &lt;/props> {code}&#xd;
As the [javamail article|https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html] {{ _"if you're using the "smtps" protocol to access SMTP over SSL, all the properties would be named "mail.smtps.*"._ which isn't happening in 8.5.7}}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Go to General configuration >> Mail server >> *Add a new SMTP mail server*&#xd;
 # Enter the information for the mail server and use port *465* >> Save{*}{*}&#xd;
 # Go back to *"View Mail Servers"* page, notice that it shows "SMTP" under protocol instead of SMTPS&#xd;
&#xd;
_Note: Performing the same steps on 7.19.x *DOES* show "{*}SMTPS{*}" under the *protocol* column in the *View Mail Servers* page._&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
SMTPS protocol should be used whenever the 465 port as in version 7.19.x (see screenshots) or a drop-down list should offer to choose SMTP or SECURE_SMTP when configuring a mail server similar to Jira&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Unable to use SMTPS even when entering the SMTPS port&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Exporting large pages to PDF leads to *StackOverflowError* even after setting high memory for stack size.&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no proper pattern as to how large the page should be which will eventually lead to the error when exported to PDF.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Increase the stack size to 100 MB (as an example)&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
CATALINA_OPTS="-Dconversion.sandbox.stack.limit.megabytes=100 ${CATALINA_OPTS}" {code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Create a large page with 1000+ lines (as an example)&#xd;
 # Export the page to PDF.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * It is expected that the PDF export of the page completes successfully&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * PDF export leads to error - StackOverflowError&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
We need to delete the data from the page and then export the page to PDF. As mentioned earlier, there is no fixed pattern of how much data (number of lines) to be retained on the page, we should follow a trial and error approach.</description><createDate>2024-02-13T11:23:09.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi,&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After upgrading Confluence 8.5.X to 8.6.X, Confluence is throwing errors about "CSSParser" while a page is being shared automatically or manually.&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite the error message, the notification will still manage to reach the recipient. However, since the error is thrown every time "NotificationSender" picks up a page, Confluence logs will get filled up with similar error messages quickly and create unnecessary noise.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) This issue is not replicable on version 8.5.X&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up Confluence 8.6.x&#xd;
 # Set up an SMTP mail server&#xd;
 # Share any page in Confluence to a user or email address&#xd;
 ** The page can even be a blank page, or simply a page with 1 line of text.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence will not return any error about the page share action, considering all the required fields are filled correctly.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence returns errors about "CSSParser" about the page share action.&#xd;
&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the {{atlassian-confluence.log}} file:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
To suppress the error messages:&#xd;
+Via "Logging and Profiling"+&#xd;
 # Go to "Logging and Profiling" in the admin menu&#xd;
 # Add "cz.vutbr.web" to the list via the text box under "Add New Entry"&#xd;
 # Set logging level to "FATAL"&#xd;
 # Click on "Add Entry"&#xd;
 # Click "Save" (bottom of the "Logging and Profiling" page)&#xd;
 # Refer [Configuring Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf89/configuring-logging-1387596331.html] documentation for more details regarding logging configuration in Confluence&#xd;
&#xd;
+Via "log4j.properties" file+&#xd;
 # Open up the {{/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties}} file&#xd;
 # Add the following line to the file:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
log4j.logger.cz.vutbr.web=FATAL &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Save the file&#xd;

We noticed that the problem is in _templates/email/html/includes/constants.vm_ file, since it contains some syntax errors and a missing css variable (used by other vm files).&#xd;
&#xd;
We had to replace this line:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#set ($menuSeparatorColour = "var(--ds-border, #bbb"){code}&#xd;
 to&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#set ($menuSeparatorColour = "var(--ds-border, #bbb)"){code}&#xd;
and &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#set ($auiWarningBorderColour = "var(--ds-border-warning, #f7df92")){code}&#xd;
to&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#set ($auiWarningBorderColour = "var(--ds-border-warning, #f7df92)"){code}&#xd;
and add missing varible&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
#set ($menuTxtColour = "var(--ds-text, #000000)"){code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
In our case, this helped and maybe also provides a guideline in uncovering the original problem.</text><author>Gergely Juhász [Midori]</author></comments><comments><text>This is still present in Confluence 9.0.3</text><author>Francisco Villar Romasanta</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 9.2.0.

*The fix for this bug will be released to our Long Term Support release.*&#xd;
&#xd;
The fix for this bug has been approved for backport and will be available in an upcoming 8.5 release of Confluence. Check the fix-version field for details.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
{panel:title=23 August 2024 Update|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554c0|titleBGColor=#6554c0|bgColor=#eae6ff}&#xd;
With the fix released by the upstream vendor, we're now investigating how to get that fix back to the version of TinyMCE used in our Confluence 8.5 LTS. Unfortunately with the options made available to us, we're having  to investigate backporting the entire editor to this LTS release, which is potentially a breaking change. We're working on it and will provide updates as we have them.&#xd;
&#xd;
Note that a separate but related improvement was made as part of [CONFSERVER-54754: Page with excessive nested span tags causes Synchrony to stop working (fixed in Confluence Data Center 8.4.0, 7.19.15)|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-54754] that has already been backported to LTS releases.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Nested spans still created in some scenarios even after [CONFSERVER-54754|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-54754] patch causing a stack overflow for Synchrony. According to development this is a bug in TinyMCE code that needs to be fixed by TinyMCE.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Reproduction steps vary.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence should flatten nested spans.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Nested spans are allowed and cause a stack overflow for Synchrony&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Install Confluence Source Code Editor&#xd;
 ** [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview]&#xd;
 # Edit the page, then click the {{Source Editor}} icon to edit the page source&#xd;
 # Search for the stack of nested tags&#xd;
 # Once identified, remove all nested {{&lt;span>&lt;/span>}} tags between the {{&lt;p>}} and {{&lt;/p>}} tags&#xd;
 # Save Page&#xd;
&#xd;
Alternately, the {{remove formatting}} editor option can be used to strip out all the formatting including these span tags.</description><createDate>2023-12-07T16:38:19.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>8.6.2 Confluence version is affected</text><author>Viktoria Boiko</author></comments><comments><text>Confluence 7.19.20.0 is affected.</text><author>Dhinesh Govindasamy</author></comments><comments><text>Confluence 7.19.22 is affected.</text><author>sypt.song</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Data Center 9.0.1.&#xd;

We have Confluence Datacenter 8.5.12 but still have pages with a lot of &lt;span> elements and therefore those pages cannot be edited.&#xd;
Is there another fix for that?&#xd;
Thanks in advance.</text><author>Jiraconfluence Solutionmgm sIT</author></comments><comments><text>Hi All,&#xd;
&#xd;
Just a quick note on this one.&#xd;
&#xd;
We've completed the backport of this issue to our 8.5 LTS branch. The fix will be available as part of Confluence 8.5.18 which is due out in December.&#xd;
&#xd;
[~ff5dbf1888d4] - This fix we've deployed will resolve the duplicated tag issue in any page that can be loaded into the editor. Any page that is degraded to the point that it cannot be loaded will not be fixed by this change.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
On the “Create page | Table” page, the aria-disabled=” true” attribute is not defined for the toolbar.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to the above-mentioned page.&#xd;
 # Add the table content in the main content area&#xd;
 # Navigate to the main content area and press Shift + Tab key&#xd;
 # Observe that the toolbar is disabled visually.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Screen Recording 2023-11-20 at 2.05.38 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the shift + tab is hit from the main content area, the toolbar visually seems to be disabled, but the toolbar section is not set as "disable" programmatically. As a result, users of screen readers won't comprehend the switch's disabled status. &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Set the HTML "disabled" attribute when the toolbar section is in the disabled state. Ensure that the attribute is removed when the section is in an active state.&#xd;
&#xd;
Alternatively, set the "aria-disabled" attribute to "true" when the section is in the disabled state. Ensure that the value of the "aria-disabled" attribute changes on user interaction via scripting.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, there is no known workaround for this behaviour. &#xd;

!Screenshot 2023-09-29 at 4.45.31 PM.png|width=352,height=171!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The "Show Blog link", "Hide Blog link", "Show Analytics link", "Hide Analystic link" and so on image links lack textual description. Screen readers announce the href value of links in the absence of appropriately defined textual descriptions. As a result, screen reader users will be unable to identify the purpose of these image links.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that appropriate textual description for the image links such as "Show Blog link", "Hide Blog link", "Show Analytics link", "Hide Analystic link" and so on are provided and completely describes the purpose of these links.&#xd;
The textual description can be provided by adding a visually hidden text using CSS within the &lt;a> element.&#xd;

&#xd;
!Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 1.38.34 PM.png|width=289,height=179!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Web page content failed to reflow when viewed at 320*256 viewport size. The content in the main content area gets overlapped with other content.&#xd;
For e.g. the content such as "List", "Timeline" tabs and "Add Event", "Subscribe" buttons gets overlapped.&#xd;
As a result, this will result in low-vision users finding it difficult to access the content.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that all the page content is visible when viewed at 320 * 256 viewport. Use relative units to define font and container sizes in CSS to ensure that the page's content reflows correctly when viewed at 320 * 256 viewport. In addition, use CSS media queries to display web page content correctly when viewed using different devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and so on.&#xd;

 # Navigate onto the above mentioned page.&#xd;
 # Navigate onto the "Reply" input field.&#xd;

&#xd;
!Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 12.18.33 PM.png|width=274,height=133!&#xd;
h3. Actual Result&#xd;
&#xd;
When Keyboard only and Screen reader users navigate to the "Reply" form field and try to add an inline comment, they are not able to do so as the input field does not get expanded and the "Save" button is not available for them. As a result, it is not at all possible to reply to any inline comment for the users of a keyboard and a screen reader. That there is an input field to enter a comment and there is no "Save" button may confuse or mislead them.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Every functionality that is available for Mouse users, must be available for Keyboard only and assistive technology users as well. In this scenario, since activating the "View inline comment" button does not automatically expand the "Reply" popup, make sure that there is a button to do the same. Hence, we would recommend you to refactor this &lt;textarea> element into a button and activating the button can then trigger the "Reply" popup.&#xd;
&#xd;
If this is not possible due to any constrains, then make sure that you hide the input field for all users with CSS display: none. As well, provide a separate button element to activate the "Reply" popup.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the focus moves onto the "Reply" textarea when the "Reply" button is activated.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The dynamically updating results is not communicated to the users of assistive technologies on accessing “@mentions” functionality. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to "Create" button present in header section.&#xd;
 # After activating "Create" blank page template will appear on the screen.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "Insert more content" button and activate it.&#xd;
 # Select the "User mention" option among them.&#xd;

!image-2023-08-16-18-14-39-266.png|width=523,height=226!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
On typing any character in the main content area preceded by an “@” symbol, the number of search results are not communicated. As well, this component cannot be adjusted with a keyboard, such as Up and Down arrow keys these options gets closed on interaction. This strange behaviour might mislead or confuse keyboard only and assistive technology users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Status messages must be programmatically determined. To achieve this, use a polite live region, such as role=”status” and aria-atomic=”true” to ensure that the entire text node containing the number of results is always announced.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that this component can be controlled with a keyboard. In this scenario, we would recommend you to modify this component in a manner such that users can use Up and Down Arrow keys to navigate amongst the options. They can then press Enter or Return key to select a particular option. Make sure that this instruction is included within the live region along with the number of search results.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Code Snippet*&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Color alone #0052CC is used to identify "go to your editor settings" link This link has a low contrast ratio of 2.1:1 with the surrounding text. This will make it difficult for low vision users and those with colorblindness to distinguish links within the block of text.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
To make it easy for all users to recognize links the best practice is to persistently underline them or provide any other visual cue such as formatting the text as bold or italic. If the above solution is not feasible, change the color of links so that they have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the surrounding text. Moreover, it is best practice to ensure that the underline appears not only when the mouse is hovered over the links but also when the links receive the keyboard focus.&#xd;

&#xd;
[^Screen Recording 2023-08-09 at 3.39.23 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the “Notification” button is expanded, the expanded content of this button is available at the end of the page for screen reader users. This is because this content is not coded directly after the button in the DOM. It is instead coded at the end of the page. This inappropriate reading order might disorient the users of screen readers. That the content is available at the end might confuse or mislead them.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Content must have an appropriate reading order. Assistive technologies navigate content using the order in which elements appear in the DOM. Hence, make sure that the content is programmatically ordered in such a way that it provides an appropriate reading order to the users of assistive technologies. Make sure that the content that gets available on expanding the buttons is coded directly after the expandable buttons in the DOM. This will create an appropriate reading order for the users of assistive technologies. For instance, this will enable them to arrow down onto the expanded content when the buttons are expanded.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user closes the mentioned modal dialog with the “close” button or ESC key, the focus moves incorrectly to the top of the page instead of the interactive element. As a result, keyboard-only and screen reader users need to pass the extra content to reach to the desired or previously interacted element. &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the user dismisses the mentioned modal dialog with the “Cancel” button or ESC key, the focus should be set to the element that triggered the modal dialog.&#xd;
&#xd;
Place the content of the webpage in a correct sequence in the source code as it appears visually.&#xd;
 * The reading order in a screen-reader is based on the order of the HTML or XHTML elements in the Document Object Model, as it is the default tab order.This technique inserts new content into the DOM immediately following the element that was activated to trigger the script.&#xd;
 * The triggering element must be a link or a button, and the script must be called from its onclick event. These elements are natively focusable, and their onclick event is device independent. Focus remains on the activated element and the new content, inserted after it, becomes the next thing in both the tab order and screen-reader reading order.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The input field such as "Reply" is missing a visible label.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:* Similar instance is found on "Create new page- editor | Edit page"&#xd;

 # Activate the Enter key using keyboard.&#xd;
 # Observe that the content is not updated.&#xd;

!Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 9.26.20 AM.png|width=408,height=203!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When the screen reader user navigates onto the mentioned field, no label is announced for it.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users would not understand the purpose of the input field and they might find it difficult to interact with the unlabelled field.&#xd;
&#xd;
Even though placeholder text is present for the field, cognitively impaired users would not be able to understand the purpose of the input field.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There should be visible label present for mentioned input field using {{&lt;label>}} element. A visible label such as "Reply"&#xd;
&#xd;
Label and input fields should be explicitly associated via “for” attribute of &lt;label> and “id” attribute of &lt;input>. Make sure that the value of “for” and “id” attributes is same.&#xd;
&#xd;
Visible labels help all users to understand the purpose of a form element.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:* Before implementing any visual label please connect with the content design team to take a suggestion/approval from them as per business logic.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Heading structure is found to be inappropriate on the page. Text such as “Admin Admin” is coded as &lt;h4> which does not match the visual hierarchy on the page.&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users found it difficult to understand the page's content structure.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It is recommended that the discussed issue be addressed, as screen reader users rely on headings to comprehend the structure of the page and modal dialog.&#xd;
&#xd;
Text such as "Admin Admin" should be coded as &lt;h3> appropriately.&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the *H1, H2,…H6* tags as indicators of section headings and subheadings within a page, not just as formatting elements. Screen readers in particular may just scan a page for appropriate H1, H2 and H3 elements.&#xd;

&#xd;
When users submit the "Create Events" form empty, error messages such as "Please select a valid user", "Field cannot be blank", "Invalid date specified. It should look like 28 Jul 2023" and so on get dynamically displayed between the form fields and user's focus remains on the "Save" button.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are unaware of the occurrence of errors.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes:&#xd;
 * Add the 'aria-describedby' attribute to the form field.&#xd;
 * Reference the 'id' attribute value of the container used to display the error message to the 'aria-describedby' attribute.&#xd;
 * Set focus on the first field with an error using the JavaScript .focus() method as soon as the form is submitted.&#xd;

[^Screen Recording 2023-07-26 at 5.57.05 PM.mov]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Focus moves inappropriately on top of the page when user activate the "Like", "Edit Labels (Type 'l')" and "Save for later" interactive elements instead of moving on the triggering element when the user close the modal dialog,&#xd;
As a result, keyboard only and screen reader users will have to navigate the screen content again before accessing the content which is after the triggering button.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When updating an attachment on a page with many incoming links, the request can be very slow or even timeout. This is due to attachment reconciliation which occurs in the background to ensure attachment consistency.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a page and copy the link to the page (called main page)&#xd;
 # Create 1500+ pages all having a hyperlink to the main page&#xd;
 # Add or update an attachment on the main page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Reconciliation should only reconcile content that references the attachment, and the request should complete in a timely manner.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Reconciliation reconciles content that references the content an attachment is "attached to" causing unnecessary reconciliation - this causes the request to take longer than necessary.&#xd;
&#xd;
In thread dumps you will find a majority of the request time in either:&#xd;
* *Pre 8.1* AttachmentRelatedContentReconciliationListener&#xd;
* *8.1+* ReconcileReferringContentTask&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
There are 3 known work-arounds:&#xd;
* Minimise how many incoming links are coming into the page&#xd;
* Optimise any Synchrony bottlenecks present in the system&#xd;
* Disable collaborative editing</description><createDate>2023-07-26T08:53:13.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi, we're having this issue in our instance of Confluence data center version 8.4.1 on a page with 72 incoming links, 20 external links, and 21 children.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The state of the buttons is not defined programmatically.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to "Search" input field present in header section.&#xd;
 # Activate it and observe that modal dialog has been appeared on the screen.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the "Advanced search" link and activate it.&#xd;
 # Navigate to the buttons present on left side of the page.&#xd;
 # Using screen reader check that state is not being announced.&#xd;

&#xd;
!Screenshot 2023-07-19 at 12.09.21 PM.png|width=416,height=205!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When user activate the button elements such as "Last month" and "Pages" the content in the page is getting updated without notifying the screen reader users. It is not announcing for screen reader due to lack of attribute in code snippet. As a result, screen reader users won't be aware of the state of all these buttons. &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that state is announcing to the screen reader users appropriately. To achieve this apply the following changes:&#xd;
 * Provide role listbox to the &lt;ul> element&#xd;
 * Add role option to the options such as "Any date", "Last 24 hours", "Last week", and so on.&#xd;
 * Provide the aria-selected attribute with value true for the selected option and make the value of this attribute should update on user interaction.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Code Snippet*&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;div class="aui-navgroup-vertical">&#xd;
&lt;ul class="aui-nav" role="listbox">&#xd;
&lt;li class="aui-nav-selected" role="option" aria-selected="true">&lt;a href="#" role="button" data-value="">Any date&lt;/a>&lt;/li>&#xd;
(...)&#xd;
&lt;/ul>&#xd;

&#xd;
!Screenshot 2023-07-17 at 3.24.37 PM.png|width=392,height=197!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There are adjacent image and textual links that point to the same destination but are defined in separate &lt;a> tags. Also, the alternate text of the image link is the same as the text of the textual link.&#xd;
As a result, screen reader users are presented with repeated information about the link which opens the same page.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
Ensure that the image and text links that point to the same destination are combined into a single link as a link block.&#xd;
 &#xd;
Apply the following changes: * Define the image and the link text within a single &lt;a> element instead of separate &lt;a> elements.&#xd;
 * Ideally alternate text must be provided to all image links using the "alt" attribute. In this instance, since the image and the textual link point to an identical destination page, use an empty ‘alt’ attribute.&#xd;
 * Use CSS if necessary to maintain the presentation of the content.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
On the "Dashboard | All popular " page, the non-modal dialog that becomes available when the user mouse hovers over “Admin Admin” is not accessible. These non-modal dialogs are coded inappropriately which makes functionality inaccessible for keyboard-only and screen reader users. Moreover, the dialog is only available on mouse hover.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The mentioned dialog should be accessible for keyboard-only and screen reader users.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make the dialog accessible by performing the following steps:&#xd;
 * Replace the avatar element with the native &lt;button> element in the source code so that it receives keyboard focus. (Currently the avatar and username element is coded in one &lt;a> tag so when users tab the keyboard focus receives both the elements)&#xd;
 * Make sure to code the button element which triggers the popup outside the &lt;a> element,since incorrect nesting is done&#xd;
 * Add {{role="dialog"}} and {{"aria-labelledby"}} attribute to the {{&lt;div>}} element containing the modal dialog heading/title for text “User name”.&#xd;
 * Specify the "id" attribute with a unique value to the element containing the heading text i.e “User name” and reference it via the {{"aria-labelledby"}} attribute.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Heading structure is found to be inappropriate on the page. Text such as “Admin Admin” is coded as &lt;h4> which does not match the visual hierarchy on the page. &#xd;
As a result, screen reader users found it difficult to understand the page's content structure.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It is recommended that the discussed issue be addressed, as screen reader users rely on headings to comprehend the structure of the page and modal dialog.&#xd;
&#xd;
Text such as "Admin Admin" should be coded as &lt;h2> appropriately.&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the *H1, H2,…H6* tags as indicators of section headings and subheadings within a page, not just as formatting elements. Screen readers in particular may just scan a page for appropriate H1, H2 and H3 elements.&#xd;

Hi Everyone,&#xd;
&#xd;
Thank you for your patience with this issue as we are still working on a complete solution.&#xd;
&#xd;
During our development, we were are able to pre-emptively release some optimisations which should help reduce the impact. This should greatly improve processing efficiency when checking many tasks on the same page.&#xd;
&#xd;
These optimisations have been released in version 8.5.10&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks!&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
While in page view mode, each inline task interaction increments the page version by one. Whilst this is not a problem in itself, when a checkbox (for inline tasks) is marked or unmarked on a Confluence page, hibernate loads the page contents twice into two string objects.&#xd;
&#xd;
With regular usage, inline tasks will eventually cause heap pressure, resulting in potentially disruptive full-GC pauses.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a relatively large Confluence page with inline tasks included on it.&#xd;
# Whilst +viewing+ the page (not editing), check and uncheck boxes for inline tasks. Programmatically, CHECKED and UNCHECKED states can be issued for a page (and taskid) via the REST API to simulate user activity automatically:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
curl -D- -u user2:user2 -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck" --data '{"status":"CHECKED","trigger":"VIEW_PAGE"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8090/rest/inlinetasks/1/task/2228225/55/ {code}&#xd;
# Whilst monitoring heap activity (via GC logs or JMX), note the heap usage increasing with each click. The larger the page, the bigger the heap usage increase per click.  Eventually this triggers full GC and heap usage remains high.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Referenced objects in the heap should not grow unbounded from the use of inline tasks.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Cannot add inline comments to similar words that exist inside a macro body, which could also be hidden. For example, in a page, a macro body contains the text "This is inside a macro" and the text "I am not inside" lives outside the macro.&#xd;
&#xd;
Adding an inline comment to the word "inside" results in this error&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
We can't add your inline comment; the section you highlighted may contain a macro or user mention. Try highlighting plain text.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
(i) This bug might be affecting other macros as well. Please, add to this list upon confirmation:&#xd;

&#xd;
We are experiencing the same issue with "Captioned Item macro" in Confluence 8.5.6 and we suspect the problem might be with the API endpoint {{{}"/rest/inlinecomments/1.0/comments"{}}}. It seems that the endpoint is not handling properly the {{"matchIndex"}}  in the API call. I have a screen capture to illustrate this but it looks like I can't attach it in the comment... but essentially:&#xd;
 # We have a simple Confluence page with some plain text containing two occurrences of _"Atlassian Confluence"_ ({{{}matchIndex 0 and 1{}}}) above a Captioned item with figure caption _"Atlassian Confluence"_ ({{{}matchIndex 2{}}}).&#xd;
 # The user selects the first occurrence of _"Atlassian Confluence"_ in the plain text ({{{}matchIndex 0{}}}) then click on "Add inline comment" in the pop-up bubble.&#xd;
 # This triggers a REST API call to the above mentioned endpoint.&#xd;
 ## The request payload JSON contains {{{}"matchIndex:0, numMatches: 3"{}}}. (GOOD)&#xd;
 ## But the API call fails with {_}412 Precondition Failed{_}. (BAD)&#xd;
&#xd;

&lt;p>Inline comment is not working if word occurs in draw.io diagram.&lt;/p>&#xd;

Apparently, the frontend JavaScript that counts the occurrences of the highlighted word simply parses the DOM regardless of where the content comes from.&#xd;

This will obviously create differences in the match/ occurrence count between DOM and storage format.</text><author>Jörn Bungartz</author></comments><comments><text>Atlassian, is there any chance that this issue will be fixed some day?

Issue Summary&#xd;
The Confluence editor is slow to load when collaborative editing is enabled&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a Confluence page with a large amount of content (such as a large table)&#xd;
# Edit the page&#xd;
# Observer the initial load time of the editor&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The editor is loaded promptly&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The page takes a prolonged time to load&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Note to Support&#xd;
When linking to this issue, please ensure the following has been captured as part of your investigation&#xd;
# A HAR file of the editor page load&#xd;
# The browser console output associated with the HAR file/editor page load&#xd;
# A storage format of the page&#xd;

Problem&#xd;
 - When multiple users are editing the same page, and click on update together&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Create a Page in Confluence&#xd;
 * Have multiple users editing the same page (I did it with 5)&#xd;
 * Have them click on publish around the same time&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
_The editions should be synchronized and published_&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
_Some of the users will receive an error when trying to save_&#xd;
_!image-2022-03-24-13-24-48-076.png|width=532,height=370!_&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
_Most of the times, publishing the page again will have it work, if you get the same error after retrying, the page will need to be refreshed, and then saved._&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
In developer tools, If we look at the post request for the draft, we can see that the API is sending a version that was sent previously by of the other users, and then it fails:&#xd;
{code:yaml}&#xd;
Request: "page"&#xd;
version: {number: 34, message: "", minorEdit: false, syncRev: "0.sO0vod7WeiIncamVjFZMWQ.0"}&#xd;
&#xd;
Response:&#xd;
{"statusCode":409,"data":{"authorized":false,"valid":true,"allowedInReadOnlyMode":true,"errors":[],"successful":false},"message":"Version must be incremented on update. Current version is: 34","reason":"Conflict"}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Some of the times, the error comes as updating a stale draft:&#xd;
{code:yaml}&#xd;
{"statusCode":409,"data":{"authorized":false,"valid":true,"allowedInReadOnlyMode":true,"errors":[],"successful":false},"message":"Attempted to update stale data. Try again.","reason":"Conflict"}&#xd;

&#xd;
Once the text is selected by the user and the comment toolbar appears then the user should be able to Tab forward and move focus to the first button in the toolbar. If you code the expanded toolbar as role=toolbar then it would need to manage keyboard focus using arrow keys to select toolbar buttons [https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A11Y/pages/1500119645/Toolbars]&#xd;
&#xd;
Basic tabbing through the buttons would be acceptable.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
The fact that the text cursor is not keyboard operable in all browsers would have to be handled by a custom keyboard cursor navigation mode or some other keyboard operable method for a user to select a word with their cursor so that they can leave a comment. This would have to be designed first most likely.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Sorting is broken in the Page Properties Report Macro, when HTML entities are written in the table cells containing the values to be sorted.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the Page Properties Report Macro there is a parameter that can be set in *Options > Sort By* and when this contains a table heading name the tabular data is sorted by default in this manner.&#xd;
&#xd;
If the page or table using the Page Properties macro is edited or values are appended to the table the page source code changes and wraps the cell values to be sorted in *&lt;div>* and/or *&lt;p>* tags. This breaks the default sort order set and displayed in the parent Page Properties Report Macro. However if the heading of the column is manually toggled, the correct sorting is activated.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a page with the Page Properties Report Macro that sorts on a heading contained in pages containing a Page Properties Macro with tabular data&#xd;
 # Edit the source pages and append values or otherwise update the table on these pages&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Default sorting set in the Page Properties Report Macro is followed and displayed correctly on page load.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Sorting is broken and does not follow the logic or parameter set in the Page Properties Report Macro&#xd;
&#xd;
The following entities are seen to wrap the cell value and therefore break the sorting. When the heading of the column is manually toggled, the correct sorting is activated.&#xd;
{code:html}&#xd;
&lt;th colspan="1">Sorted by this column&lt;/th>&#xd;
                &lt;td colspan="1"&gt;&#xd;
                  &lt;div class="content-wrapper">&#xd;
                    &lt;p>1.0&lt;/p>&#xd;
                  &lt;/div>&#xd;
		&lt;/td>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
By editing the page source code with the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210722/confluence-source-editor?tab=overview&amp;hosting=server] one can remove the HTML entities from the table cell value restoring the correct default sort order.</description><createDate>2021-12-13T13:12:23.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>CalendarReminderJob is sending multiple notifications for recurrent events</summary><key>CONFSERVER-67979</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-67979</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
A single notification event is received 5 mins before the start of the event.&#xd;

We have 500 users in a very bureaucratic environment, for which the starting times of events need to be unambiguous to avoid confusion. Starting all meetings 1-2 min later due to a bug in calendar events is not reasonable either. </text><author>Luisa Grams</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Viewing a large page with  attachments macro  causes slow loads and timeouts. </summary><key>CONFSERVER-63527</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-63527</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

h3. Notes&#xd;
Fastpermissions didn't help in this instance. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
 Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available</description><createDate>2021-04-08T17:08:28.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Our organization is severely affected by this problem since the upgrade to Confluence 7.11.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have hundreds of complex pages that can't be displayed any longer due to a timeout. Virtually leaves Confluence partially unusable for us.&#xd;
&#xd;
Very annoying to say the least...</text><author>Daniel Köck</author></comments><comments><text>My organization is also affected by this problem, pages with many attachments are essentially unusable. Here an extract from a profiling session:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
[222.5ms] - PermissionManager.hasCreatePermission()&#xd;
 [221.9ms] [count: 14, avg: 15.8ms] - CrowdService.isUserMemberOfGroup() &#xd;
  [216.2ms] [count: 16, avg: 13.5ms] - MembershipDao.searchGroupedByName(){code}&#xd;
if you now have a more complex permission structure with many groups and many attachments and the permission check for each attachment is >200 ms you get page load times of around 20s - 30s.&#xd;
&#xd;
Maybe the issue is related to the caching of group memberships? Because it also does not get better with repeated page loads.</text><author>Lukas Reichart</author></comments><comments><text>On the confluence database I see *a lot* of queries of the format:&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
SELECT  internalgr1_.group_name AS col_0_0_,  hibernatem0_.child_group_id AS col_1_0_,  internalgr2_.id AS id1_28_,  internalgr2_.group_name AS group_na2_28_,  internalgr2_.lower_group_name AS lower_gr3_28_,  internalgr2_.active AS active4_28_,  internalgr2_.local AS local5_28_,  internalgr2_.created_date AS created_6_28_,  internalgr2_.updated_date AS updated_7_28_,  internalgr2_.description AS descript8_28_,  internalgr2_.group_type AS group_ty9_28_,  internalgr2_.directory_id AS directo10_28_,  internalgr2_.external_id AS externa11_28_ FROM  cwd_membership hibernatem0_ CROSS JOIN  cwd_group internalgr1_ INNER JOIN  cwd_group internalgr2_ ON  hibernatem0_.child_group_id=internalgr2_.id WHERE  hibernatem0_.parent_id=internalgr1_.id AND (hibernatem0_.child_user_id IS NULL) AND (internalgr1_.lower_group_name IN ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, $16, $17, $18, $19, $20, $21, $22, $23, $24, $25, $26, $27, $28, $29, $30, $31, $32, $33, $34, $35, $36, $37, $38, ...&#xd;
 &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
which for me would be another indicator that this is a caching-related problem?&#xd;
 </text><author>Lukas Reichart</author></comments><comments><text>@Lukas Reichart:&#xd;
We have analyzed the cache with Atlassian Support and they said the cache is fine.&#xd;
&#xd;
The problem seems to be due to a different method with permission checks that has been introduced with Confluence 7.11 (from what I understood).&#xd;
&#xd;
If you add the user to the confluence-administrators group, the problem disappears for this user, because for the admins, these permission checks are skipped. So, adding the users to this group is the only workaround (apart from rebuilding all affected pages and make them less complex). Of course, giving users full admin permissions is not a workaround that can be used in most organizations...</text><author>Daniel Köck</author></comments><comments><text>We are having problems with simply viewing restricted pages rather than attachments.&#xd;
All sub-pages of a page with complex permissions applied take a long time to display the page.&#xd;

We are running a 7.11.1 in production without a sync to our active directory, because of the bug https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-61194. We needed to restart the app-server while a sync job to the ad. So the sync gets stuck and there is no way get it working again.&#xd;
&#xd;
So we need to upgrade to version 7.12 and hoped for a fix. On the other hand we need to active the "nested" group function for a rollout of our installation.&#xd;
&#xd;
So we updated to 7.12 and activated the "nested" group-feature. The update failed 2x times because if some load goes to our installation the database cpu utilisation got up to 100% and caused a outage of the whole production system.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is a very frustrating situation for us and we need a fix to go on.</text><author>christoph.lamprecht</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available to Server and Data Center customers in Confluence 7.11.3&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After adding a PNG image to the page and applying a visual effect to it, the image is rendered much bigger (up to 30x and even more compared to the original size). As a result, it leads to the pages with lots of PNG attachments to go over 100+ mb in size that may refuse to open.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 - Spin up a clean Confluence Server instance with AdoptOpenJDK-11. (used latest Docker image - 7.11.1)&#xd;
 - Add a PNG image to the page&#xd;
 - Apply the "Snapshot" visual effect to the image.&#xd;
 - Save the page&#xd;
 - Open developer tools in the browser, disable the cache and refresh the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
Note: The 'Snapshot' effect is mentioned here, but the outcome is the same, regardless of the effect used (Taped, Instant Camera, Curl Shadow, Snapshot, Drop Shadow).&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The effect-applied image's size remains close to its original size.&#xd;
!bugreport_adoptjdk8_1.jpg|thumbnail! &#xd;
!bugreport_adoptjdk8_2.jpg|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The effect-applied image dramatically increases in size.&#xd;
!bugreport_adoptjdk11_1.jpg|thumbnail! &#xd;
!bugreport_adoptjdk11_2.jpg|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
For Confluence versions prior to 8.0.0, using either Oracle or OpenJDK 8 will mitigate the problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
For Confluence versions after 8.0.0, the only known workaround is to use a 3rd-party PNG optimiser (such as {{{}optipng{}}}) to optimise the size of PNG files in the image effects cache (eg. {{{}&lt;sharedhome>/imgEffects/{}}}). This workaround can be used prior to Confluence 8.0 as well.</description><createDate>2021-03-18T08:07:59.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Using Oracle JDK 11 does not help. In fact, it often makes the problem worse. The exception is with the customer screenshot and sniptool files - Oracle JDK 11 does perform slightly better.&#xd;

h3. Problem&#xd;
When setting space or global permissions in Confluence, external group names containing a comma (",") trigger an error message instead of being added successfully. This issue affects external user directories such as LDAP or Active Directory, preventing correct permission assignments.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
Confluence Server &amp; Data Center&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Set up an external user management system such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.&#xd;
# Sync an external group that contains a comma (",") in its name (e.g., "Engineering, DevOps").&#xd;
# Navigate to the *Global Permissions* or *Space Permissions* settings page in Confluence.&#xd;
# Search the group.&#xd;
# Select the synced external group with a comma in its name from the *popup dropdown list*.&#xd;
# Click Add to assign permissions.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The group should be added successfully with its full name preserved.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* The system displays an error message, preventing the group from being added.&#xd;
* This issue affects all external groups with commas in their names.&#xd;
!Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 5.32.35 PM.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
# Instead of selecting the group from the dropdown list, click the *magnifying glass button* next to the "Add" button.&#xd;
# In the pop-up window, search for the group again and select it from there.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Starting in February 2020, Chrome version 80 (and later Firefox and IE as well) will start enforcing different requirements on cross-site cookies. Reference [https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html] for full details on the change in Chrome's behavior.&#xd;
&#xd;
Warnings about this can be seen in the Developer Tools console when navigating to pages that have content from an app-linked Jira instance. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # (prior to the Chrome version 80 rollout) In Chrome version 77+ go to "chrome://flags/"&#xd;
 # Search for "SameSite" and enable "SameSite by default cookies" and "Cookies without SameSite must be secure"&#xd;
 # In a Confluence instance which has an application link to a Jira instance, navigate to a Confluence page that has integrated content from Jira (gadgets, issue filters, etc.) &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira content will be displayed and no warning messages about the cross-site cookies will be displayed in the Developer Tools console. &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Jira content is displayed and the below message is displayed in the Developer Tools console:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
A cookie associated with a cross-site resource at http://JIRA-HOSTNAME/ &#xd;
was set without the `SameSite` attribute. A future release of Chrome will &#xd;
only deliver cookies with cross-site requests if they are set &#xd;
with `SameSite=None` and `Secure`. You can review cookies in &#xd;
developer tools under Application>Storage>Cookies and see &#xd;
more details at https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592 &#xd;
and https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032.&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior within Confluence. &#xd;
 * Disable `SameSite` change at Chrome as described in [Turning off Google Chrome SameSite Cookie Enforcement|https://support.siteimprove.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360007364778-Turning-off-Google-Chrome-SameSite-Cookie-Enforcement].&#xd;
 * Add cookie headers (SameSite=None) at Tomcat level, Tomcat 8.5.42 introduced a global same-site cookie setting in the default _Rfc6265CookieProcessor_.  Check [Tomcat and Jetty SameSite Workarounds|https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/DEV/Tomcat+and+Jetty+SameSite+Workarounds] for more details&#xd;
 * Add cookie headers at the proxy level:&#xd;
 ** For example, if using HAProxy, set _SameSite=None_ and explicitly add _Secure_ as it's required (credit to [~ov3]):&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
http-response replace-header Set-Cookie ^(.*) \1;\ SameSite=None;\ Secure&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 ** Likewise for F5, an iRule can be utilized:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
# Set SameSite attribute for the JSESSIONID cookie to "lax"&#xd;
when HTTP_RESPONSE {&#xd;
    if {[HTTP::cookie exists "JSESSIONID"]}{&#xd;
        HTTP::cookie attribute "JSESSIONID" remove {samesite}&#xd;
        HTTP::cookie attribute "JSESSIONID" insert {samesite} "lax"&#xd;
    }&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;

We are doing an integration of Confluence content in another system and this policy prevents the data to be loaded.</text><author>Andi Muka</author></comments><comments><text>Hi all,&#xd;
&#xd;
we at [resolution|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/vendors/1210947/resolution-reichert-network-solutions-gmbh] have created a very small open-source app as another workaround if your Confluence version is too old for the Tomcat workaround (or you can't / don't want to modify your config files) and you don't use / don't want to configure a load balancer that can modify the header for you.&#xd;
&#xd;
The (unsupported) app can be downloaded at [https://bitbucket.org/resolutiongmbh/add-samesite-cookie-attribute-plugin/downloads/] . It's very small and only sets the {{SameSite=None}} (and {{secure}}) flags on the JSESSIONID cookie. It's as simple as installing the app (restarting the instance might be necessary). You can consult the README in that repository for more information. &#xd;
&#xd;
If you're using [our SAML SSO app|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212129/saml-single-sign-on-confluence-sso-confluence-saml-sso?hosting=datacenter&amp;tab=overview], that same code is already included starting with version 4.0.7 and can be activated in the app's settings under the "Advanced" tab. </text><author>Tobi Theobald (resolution)</author></comments><comments><text>Tobias,&#xd;
&#xd;
Is there a minimum Confluence version for your SameSite app to work? I tried installing it in Confluence 5.1.3 and it spit back an error.&#xd;
&#xd;

 </text><author>Deleted Account</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Terry,&#xd;
&#xd;
I haven't tested it on such an old (7 years?) Confluence version. My guess would be that the Java version 8 was not yet supported back then. If that's the case, you could try compiling it to an older version of Java by modifying the pom.xml . &#xd;
&#xd;
But again, this is unsupported, so that's all I'm going to say on that topic. And your Confluence version is horribly out of date, which poses a security risk.</text><author>Tobi Theobald (resolution)</author></comments><comments><text>Our Confluence server is running Java version "1.8.0_92" so it must be something else. Anything else come to mind?&#xd;
&#xd;
Terry&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Deleted Account</author></comments><comments><text>[~tobitheo] - THANK YOU SO MUCH. The confluence .jar plugin that you provided quickly resolved this sudden issue for us. We use Resolution's SSO add-on for JSD to resolve the issue where Refined for ServiceDesk breaks the Okta SSO redirect in the customer portal, so now we are using two of your add-ons ;) &#xd;
&#xd;
This issue came onto our radar because Chrome now forcibly drops Confluence's cookies when we embed the confluence iFrame into our JSD portal. &#xd;
&#xd;
Is there any tangible difference between solving the problem with your .jar file, versus solving it at the Apache level? </text><author>Will Balson</author></comments><comments><text>@wbalson1084395757 Glad to hear it's working for you and that you're happy with our SSO app :)&#xd;
There's probably not a big difference between these options. Both techniques have their pros &amp; cons. For example who's responsible (if the person maintaining Confluence is different from the person maintaining the reverse proxy), where do you do the modification so you know to revert it if the feature comes at some point. Stuff like that. What I could see is that is probably takes more trust into a third party developer (hi :) ) to install one of their JARs instead of doing a config change in your reverse proxy. The chance of such a JAR file failing at some point when doing upgrades is probably higher than Apache deciding to change their config format.&#xd;
I also haven't tested what the performance impact of both techniques would be. I think it should be pretty minimal on both platforms though.&#xd;
So if I were an admin, my preferred solution in order of most to least preferred would be: Tomcat config option > Reverse proxy config > JAR file > Disabling option in Chrome&#xd;
(I would prefer the Tomcat solution over the others because I think SameSite cookie policy is a thing the application should be responsible for and it doesn't require installing a third party software. But I do realize that it might not be an option for people who don't have a new enough Confluence version, which is likely why you're reading this in the first place ;) )</text><author>Tobi Theobald (resolution)</author></comments><comments><text>Affecting 8.5.8 but with the .jar plugin from Tobi Theobald we could resolve the issue. :) Does it open any security vulnerabilities [~a6fe340952da] when you set samesite to secure with your plugin or on the proxy level?</text><author>Christopher Orendi</author></comments><comments><text>A fix for this issue is available in Confluence Server and Data Center 8.5.20.

&#xd;
When clicking the App Switcher in Confluence (Application Navigator), the links don't come up and we receive an error message instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
 !appswitcher-fail.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 - Confluence 6.13+&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install Confluence 6.13.0 or later;&#xd;
 # Go to *Administration > Application Navigator*;&#xd;
 # Add a new link;&#xd;
 ** If you have an Application Link configured (e.g. Jira), it will automatically add a new line.&#xd;
 ** If there's no Application Link, anything works, like Name: "Google" - URL: "https://google.com";&#xd;
 # Reload the page and click the App switcher (top right corner) button to confirm it's working;&#xd;
 # Log out and click the App switcher again.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The links appear just fine.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The popup only shows "Something went wrong, please try again."&#xd;
&#xd;
Nothing appears in the application logs, but browser network console reveals a 401 response if we click the "Try again" link:&#xd;

h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Enabling *Anonymous access* in Global Permissions is a possible workaround, since this is caused by an unauthorized request.

Issue Summary&#xd;
When creating Shared Links by using an address without valid certification (such as an internal URL for example), the creation fails.&#xd;

Steps to reproduce&#xd;
 * Set up Confluence 6.6.7 with a SQL Server 2014 v12.0.5589 database (may affect other versions of SQL Server as well)&#xd;
 * Populate the database with data with dimensions similar to this:&#xd;
 ** Over 2 million rows in the content table&#xd;
 ** At least one user with ~10,000 documents or versions of documents modified&#xd;
 * Visit the recently worked on tab in the dashboard&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Expected results&#xd;
&#xd;
Dashboard tab loads in a timely manner.&#xd;
h2. Actual results&#xd;
&#xd;
Dashboard tab never loads. The database CPU spikes for a long time and the query takes about 30 minutes to return. Due to the database being so busy this can cause stability issues causing the rest of Confluence to stop working as well.&#xd;
h2. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The best workaround at the moment is to disable the feature. This involves 2 steps:&#xd;
 # Modify your reverse proxy settings to block requests to the search endpoint when the any requests matching this pattern is issued:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
/rest/api/content/search\?.*recentlyModifiedPagesAndBlogPostsByUser.*{noformat}&#xd;
Unfortunately there is no way to do this within Tomcat or Confluence itself.&#xd;
 # Add the following CSS to remove the link from the dashboard:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
.confluence-dashboard li.nav-item-container-recently-worked {&#xd;
    display: none;&#xd;
}&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When there are several all-day events on a Calendar, the "hourly" portion of the calendar can become unusably small in the "Week" view, depending on the size of the browser window.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
Verified in Chrome and Firefox, using Team Calandars 6.0.12 on Confluence 6.8.0.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In Team Calendars, create 4 or more all-day events with long descriptions&#xd;
 # Select the "Week" view&#xd;
 # Adjust the width of the window to various sizes&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * At all window sizes, the calendar adjusts to show all data&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * At a certain width, the "All day" section takes over, leaving the "hourly" portion just a few pixels tall.&#xd;
 * The exact behavior and window size seems to vary based on the data shown in the calendar, but in the example below, the issue presented itself when the browser was between about 1500 and 2340 pixels wide:&#xd;
 !calendar_bug_example.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 * At smaller sizes, the entire agenda block is scrollable, allowing you to scroll down to move up the "All day" portion and see more of the "Hourly" portion. When this bug is happening, however, the "All day" and "Hourly" section heights are fixed.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Adjust the window to a different size and refresh the page.</description><createDate>2018-06-01T20:14:32.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Labels List Macro should not include results from Space trash and Drafts</summary><key>CONFSERVER-55441</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-55441</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h2. Summary&#xd;
The Labels List macro is returning labels that match content which are only in the space trash. These labels should be excluded from the macro as users cannot actually access those pages in the trash.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
# Create a page and add a label to it&#xd;
# Create another page in the same space with the "Labels List" macro&#xd;
# Delete the first page so that it goes to the space trash&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Expected behavior&#xd;
The Labels List macro should not show the label, as there are no accessible content with that label&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Actual behavior&#xd;
The Labels List macro still shows the label. When clicked, the ensuing page shows "There are no pages at the moment." This can be confusing to users.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Workaround&#xd;
* Purge the trash (which will permanently delete the page) or publish the drafts&#xd;
* OR, if you wish for the page to remain in the trash, recover the page and remove the label before re-deleting it, or remove the label from the draft page</description><createDate>2018-04-27T18:17:19.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>tested the work around of purging the trash, however this did not solve, and the label had to be added to the filter out setting of the macro.</text><author>Valerie Hunt</author></comments><comments><text>have purged the trash in our confluence space, however this did not remove all of the empty labels.... </text><author>kassandra.kenny</author></comments><comments><text>After converting hundreds if not thousands of lucid images, we now find that our labels list includes "lucid-conversion-&lt;number>" for every converted image.

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The copy page hierarchy tool was introduced in Confluence 6.0.1. We have found that in some cases, the copy page hierarchy can cause CPU to spike in Confluence prompting a restart.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a space with thousands of page within it - in our example, this was generated from a space with 40k pages in it&#xd;
 # Visit a page with an extensive page hierarchy&#xd;
 # *...* > Copy&#xd;
 # Select a destination space and home page.&#xd;
 # Mark the box for Include Child Pages&#xd;
 # From the next modal, leave the following options all marked: Labels, Attached files and images, Restrictions&#xd;
 # Click copy to start the process&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The copy page hierarchy will complete and maintain an expected amount of CPU.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The copy page hierarchy causes high CPU and a long running query, that appear as such in thread dumps, SQL logging:&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Newly embedded GIFs in the page will not autoplay or animate&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new blank page in Confluence&#xd;
 # Add animated gif to a page&#xd;
 You can use bellow gif as an example:&#xd;
 !spidey.gif!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * gif autoplay on the page once the page is saved as it was in previous Confluence versions&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
GIFs remains static and does not animate unless previewed&#xd;
GIFs inserted into pages prior to upgrade continue to autoplay&#xd;
&#xd;
If checked on source editor, thumbnail preview can be seen to be added to the image, preventing autoplay:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
ac:thumbnail="true"&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
If the page is inspected, the same thumbnail can be observed under image class&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-thumbnail" ....&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
* The Issue is not observed for large gifs, only for small icon size&#xd;
* The issue is not observed when copy pasting the GIF directly from clipboard into Confluence editor&#xd;
* The issue is not observed on Confluence 5.10.*&#xd;
* The issue is not observed on Gifs inserted prior to the upgrade&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
* Editing image and applying *Effect* will result in image autoplay correctly and no actual effect applied&#xd;
* Edit the page and ensure that the GIF is not on *thumbnail* size. GIFs on Original size will work correctly. &#xd;
 !CONFSERVER-55191-workaround.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
* Using [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview] to remove *thumbnail* tag from gif source: *ac:thumbnail="true"* will allow autoplay&#xd;

I've updated the steps above to do so. &#xd;
 As for locating all gifs in a space, it seems like Confluence don't have this specific feature yet. However, you can filter your search in Confluence to list out all the attachments in that specific space, by going to Advanced Search (or go to &lt;base_URL>/dosearchsite.action?), put in the name of the space in the "In Space" section, as well as selecting "Attachments" under the Of Type menu. More information about search syntax can be found [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/search-139528.html]. Hope this helps!&#xd;
&#xd;
Update: We can make use Confluence search syntax. Follow [How to search specific attachment type in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-search-specific-attachment-type-in-confluence-975027237.html]&#xd;
&#xd;

It appears the relevant user language preference is cached by confluence, tomcat and/or the apache reverse proxy.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Steps to reproduce:*&#xd;
 # Restart Confluence, maybe clear proxy caches&#xd;
 # User with e.g. hungarian language preference edits a site and opens the macro browser&#xd;
 # Confluence's cache gets poisoned with a hungarian cache result&#xd;
 # User with english language preference openes the macro browser with a cold browser cache and gets the hungarian-flavored cache result&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround:*&#xd;
 # Open the browsers dev tools and disable caching&#xd;
 # Browser forces a server-side cache refresh&#xd;

 # Define some groups in Default Group Memberships;&#xd;
 # Save and sync the directory;&#xd;
 # Log into Confluence with a User to be added to the default groups;&#xd;
 # Check the Audit Log;&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected results&#xd;
&#xd;
We see a change "User added to group" made by the user "System", just as any other automatic user change, like a directory sync.&#xd;
h3. Actual results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user responsible for the change is "Anonymous". There are also the IP addresses from Confluence host server and from the client machine used to log in.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Notes*&#xd;
If the group doesn't exist when the action above is triggered, we can also see an entry "Group created" changed by the last user that edited the User Directory along with the same IP addresses described above.</description><createDate>2017-10-23T18:30:47.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This issue is causing my Confluence license count to be exceeded and shutting down the ability for users to edit pages until we remove the users who were added anonymously to the confluence-users access group.</text><author>Ralph Ruggiero</author></comments><comments><text>I would like to increase the priority/criticality of this issue.

 # Confirm that the administrator is a system administrator, not merely a Confluence administrator.&#xd;
 # Confirm that email notifications are enabled in UPM settings.&#xd;
 # As an admin, allow add-on request.&#xd;
 # Login with a test user and request an add-on.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The system administrator will receive an email notification with the request or a notification in the workbox.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No notifications are sent&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

Go to the *Find new Add-ons* page and in the filter, select "Most requested".</description><createDate>2017-10-05T19:54:32.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary> image in edit mode adds "confluence-thumbnail" class unnecessarily causing poor image to be displayed</summary><key>CONFSERVER-53298</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-53298</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Copy and pasting image into pages while editing, or uploading images while editing does not work correctly with Internet Explorer.&#xd;
&#xd;
Internet Explorer imports the image file with the tag {{ac:thumbnail="true"}} causing the image to be blurry. This does not affect other web browsers when they are used to upload/paste images to pages as they will not include the {{ac:thumbnail=true"}} tag once saved. &#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 * Internet Explorer 11&#xd;
* Microsoft Edge Version 81.0.416.68 (Official build) (64-bit)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In Windows use Snipping Tool&#xd;
 # Create a new Image&#xd;
 # Copy the image with the copy button&#xd;
 # Ctrl+V to Confluence page, or upload a saved image to a page using the image upload feature&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Image inserted in Internet Explorer should be sharp as appear in Chrome like below. &#xd;
 !chrome.JPG|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Image show as blurry in Internet Explorer&#xd;
 !IE.JPG|thumbnail!&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
Comparing the Storage Format of the page you will see:&#xd;
 * Chrome&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;p>&lt;ac:image ac:height="162">&lt;ri:attachment ri:filename="image2017-8-30_14-1-9.png" />&lt;/ac:image>&lt;/p>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Internet Explorer&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;p>&lt;ac:image ac:thumbnail="true" ac:height="162">&lt;ri:attachment ri:filename="image2017-8-30_14-0-51.png" />&lt;/ac:image>&lt;/p>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Option 1: Use a different web browser other than IE to upload images to the page while editing&#xd;
 Option 2: Resize the blurry image, then resize it back to the desired size and it will appear correctly once saved, as this removes the tag&#xd;
h3. Mass clean-up&#xd;
&#xd;
Run the following SQL statement to replace the {{ac:thumbnail="true"}} value with a blank value in all pages and all previous versions of pages including drafts:&#xd;
{code:sql|title=works on Postgres}&#xd;
UPDATE BODYCONTENT&#xd;
SET body = replace(body,'ac:thumbnail="true"','') &#xd;
WHERE body LIKE '%ac:thumbnail="true"%';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
{code:sql|title=works on MS SQL}&#xd;
UPDATE BODYCONTENT&#xd;
   SET BODY = REPLACE (CONVERT(VARCHAR(MAX), BODY), 'ac:thumbnail="true"','')&#xd;
 WHERE BODY LIKE '%ac:thumbnail="true"%';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
(!) Always make a full backup of the database and be prepared to roll back before directly editing the db. &#xd;
&#xd;
When done with the search and replace statement above, go to *General Configuration -> Cache Management -> "Advanced View"* and click *"Flush All"* at the very bottom of the page. This is so cached versions of pages which have this code still in their storage format will be reloaded from the database at next page visit.&#xd;
&#xd;
You may need to clear browser cache as well or hold down shift+refresh on the page to load the page not from existing browser cache. &#xd;
&#xd;
(i) Note: using Internet Explorer to upload new images into pages moving forward will embed the {{ac:thumbnail="true"}} value again. This can be avoided by resizing the image to anything else while editing, then resizing back to the size you want before saving the page.  </description><createDate>2017-08-23T12:27:28.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>It would be nice if this issue could be fixed.

Summary&#xd;
Four Crucible gadgets are not working in Confluence. You can find them in the Macro Browser and also configure the gadgets. However, after clicking on the "Insert" button, nothing happens and you are not able to save/update the page anymore.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Confluence 6.2.3&#xd;
* FeCru 4.4.2&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create an AppLink between FeCru.&#xd;
# Register an External Feed in Confluence:&#xd;
{code:title=FeCru feed url}&#xd;
http://gviana:8060/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/feed&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Clear the plugins cache to ensure that no corrupted cache will cause the problem.&#xd;
# Open the macro browser and select one of the following gadgets:&#xd;
#* Hassle Review Blockers&#xd;
#* Overdue Reviews&#xd;
#* Review Inbox&#xd;
#* Review Coverage&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Confluence will render the gadgets properly as how it happens with JIRA.&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Enabling the *Manage User Status Locally* option on a _connector user directory_ doesn't give the administrator an option to activate/deactivate users if the directory is configured as _Read Only_ or as _Read Only, with Local Groups_.&#xd;
(i) This option is only available when connecting to "Microsoft Active Directory" type&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Based on the description in our [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/connecting-to-an-ldap-directory-229838241.html]:&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
|Manage User Status Locally|If true, you can activate and deactivate users in Crowd independent of their status in the directory server.|&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
checking the "Manage User Status Locally" option should allow the administrator to activate/deactivate users even if the directory permission is set to _Read Only_ or _Read Only, with Local Groups_.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
If the administrator access the user details from a user provisioned by the external directory, the option to enable (activate) or disable (deactivate) the user isn't available on the UI.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.&#xd;
# Configure a connector Microsoft Active Directory as described in [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/connecting-to-an-ldap-directory-229838241.html].&#xd;
#* Make sure to configure it as a _Read Only_ or _Read Only, with Local Groups_ directory and to enable the _Manage User Status Locally_ option.&#xd;
# Confirm the user directory synchronization works as expected.&#xd;
# Access a user details from any user synchronized from the external directory configured in steps above.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The option to enable or disable a user is available in the UI, since according to the documentation, the activate/deactivate status stays in Confluence(embeded Crowd) independent to the external directory.&#xd;
 !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The option to enable or disable a user is *not* available in the UI.&#xd;
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Temporarily set the directory as _Read/Write_ and manage the status of the target users.&#xd;
After performing the actions, set the user directory to the previous configuration (_read only_ or _read only with local groups_).</description><createDate>2017-08-21T10:20:05.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We have the same issue here on 6.0.5.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
User does not have an entry in the {{user_mapping}} table and you receive an empty result:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
user_key | username | lower_username&#xd;
--------------------------------&#xd;
(0 rows)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround 1: Finding the user_mapping key from a previous database backup and restoring it manually*&#xd;
# Restore a database dump to a new database or an old xml backup to a new instance&#xd;
# Run the following SQL query against your restored database dump/restored instance to find the user mapping key for that user:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT * FROM user_mapping WHERE username='&lt;user name>';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Then run this query against your instance to restore the user_key:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
INSERT INTO user_mapping VALUES ('&lt;user_key_from_previous_query>', '&lt;user name>', '&lt;user name>');&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
*Workaround 2: Replacing the user_mapping entry with a new user_key*&#xd;
(!) Please note that *this workaround is not recommended* and is provided for informational purposes. Userkeys need to be unique and generating them randomly can cause failures down the line. If you have any information regarding changes made to the user account prior to this issue appearing, please let us know.&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Use the following SQL query to *add the entry manually:*&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
INSERT INTO user_mapping VALUES ('2c9681954172cf560000000000000001', '&lt;user name>', '&lt;user name>');&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 ** Note that both the &lt;user name> above has to be in all *lowercase*&#xd;
 ** Always back up your data before performing any modifications to the database. If possible, test any insert, update, or delete SQL commands on a staging server first.&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that:&#xd;

&#xd;
Adding 'submit comments' when you publish is important for users who were familiar with a previous version and want to know what the changes are without having to look through it.&#xd;
&#xd;
Deleting these 'submit comments' when you add an 'inline comment' is obviously a bad bug.&#xd;

1. edit page content&#xd;
2. enter change comment and publish page&#xd;
3. check change comment in page history - comment exists&#xd;
4. display page again and place inline comment on a text&#xd;
5. check change comment again in page history - comment has disappeared&#xd;

The bug has been known since 2016, affects countless versions and is classified as low/minor? That is completely inappropriate! &#xd;
Just as with bug CONFSERVER-59497 (Tasks are marked as finished/unfinished randomly and without user action), which was ranked low/minor for months and was only prioritised high after massive pressure from us and escalation to the Atlassian Channel Manager.&#xd;
&#xd;
Sometimes I really get the impression that you don't know how your customers use your software and what kind of impact such bugs have.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have thousands of technical documents that are briefly described with change comments when changes are made. In addition, the changes are marked and explained in the document with inline comments. This allows the user to see very quickly what is new in the document.&#xd;

*STEPS TO REPLICATE*&#xd;
# Create Applink between Confluence 5.8.x and JIRA 7.1.7&#xd;
# Create several JIRA Issue *type (Epic/Story/Bug/Task)* in *JIRA 7.1.7* (Bug seems not reproducible in Jira 6.3.x and 6.4.x) under same project&#xd;
# Create a page in Confluence and insert JIRA Issue Macro which will list all the JIRA issue in the project. &#xd;
# Save the page.&#xd;
# Export the page to PDF.&#xd;
&#xd;
*EXPECTED RESULT*&#xd;
All the JIRA Issue type icon (Epic/Story/Bug/Task) will show up in the PDF Export.&#xd;
&#xd;
*ACTUAL RESULT*&#xd;
JIRA Issue Type Icon missing in Confluence Page PDF Export. (Refer to attached image)&#xd;
&#xd;
*DIAGNOSIS*&#xd;
From the Confluence logs we can see that Confluence is reaching for the following URL to get the Icon:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
WARN [http-nio-8090-exec-8] [confluence.extra.flyingpdf.ConfluenceExportUserAgent] getImageResource Could not retrieve image resource http://10.60.2.212:8080/jira717/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&amp;avatarId=10307&amp;avatarType=issuetype during Confluence export&#xd;

{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
However, from JIRA database, the following query shows that the URL for the Icon is different:&#xd;
{code}select iconurl from issuetype where pname = 'Epic' ;{code}&#xd;
{code}"/images/icons/issuetypes/epic.svg"{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
*NOTES*&#xd;
This bug only reproducible with JIRA 7.x.x (Tested with JIRA 7.1.7)</description><createDate>2016-05-27T10:43:25.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Also happens with Scroll HTML export</text><author>Apiomat Admin</author></comments><comments><text>This is major issue with how we intend to use Jira and Confluence to combine in an autonomous solution that outputs client facing documentation. We are only in the concept phases and while all other areas of issue have been resolved, this is a major sticking point that if left unresolved means we will have to abandon.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have found that pictures not exporting is a business critical aspect of our change proposals with clients, and illustrations must be visible on what is effectively becomes a legal binding contract. These are built up from combining a collection of issues that form tasks that must then be followed in order to meet the set requirements.&#xd;

When viewing pages with a large amount of comments in Confluence, the page will take a very long time to load. A page with 200+ comments from different users slows dramatically when loading. &#xd;
&#xd;
I see the *content* (the actual comments) loading quickly - but I see a *lot* of GET requests thereafter - many of which are pulling avatars for each of the users that are commenting in the instance, together with a lot of what appears to be template calls.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is really slow (took 32 seconds to load a page) on the instance I tested on, and it does require many users with avatars to see the effect.I believe those things should be pulled from cache, not retrieved on every comment. That would likely speed up the page load.</description><createDate>2016-05-23T19:55:16.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I assume Atlassian doesn't want to fix any of their server customer issues </text><author>Sayan Kaiser</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Attachment add via REST APIs fails with 500 response</summary><key>CONFSERVER-41047</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-41047</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>This appears to be a frequently hit error when attachments are added concurrently.&#xd;

h4. Table Filter and Charts for Confluence&#xd;
This bug affects *Table Filter and Charts for Confluence* app. When doing page export, the *Table Filter and Charts for Confluence* app creates files for the page's macros output that will be used later. It attaches the file to the custom content entity. So when two different files are attached to the custom content entity at the same time it fails to attach one of them as described.&#xd;
The issue on *Table Filter and Charts for Confluence* can be identified by these logs:&#xd;

&#xd;
Link in JIRA Chart (Two dimensional) is incorrect.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
* Confluence 5.9.6&#xd;
* JIRA 7.1.1&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create an application link between Confluence and JIRA&#xd;
# Create a project (e.g. test) and an issue (e.g. TEST-1) on JIRA&#xd;
# Create a page on Confluence and set JIRA Chart Macro and configure a filter (e.g. {{project = test}}) on the page&#xd;
# Click a link in the chart as follows&#xd;
 !jira_chart.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Move to *JIRA Issue Search* page with some filter and there should be no error on the page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Move to *JIRA Issue Search* page with the condition that no filter was set and an error was shown on the page&#xd;
 !jira_filter.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
This problem never happen on any other link in the chart aside from the one mentioned above. It looks like the final column is just summing all the items up instead of referring to a JIRA filter as shown in the screenshot:&#xd;
&#xd;

Disable/Delete the problematic User Directory before recreating group</description><createDate>2015-10-26T08:56:04.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Confluence remigrates Wiki Markup content on restart if a plugin is updated</summary><key>CONFSERVER-37710</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-37710</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The recent fix in Confluence 5.7.4 ( -CONF-35004- ) means that on each restart following a plugin update/upgrade/install, Confluence attempts to re-migrate all our "unmigrated" pages (1,800 pages and their attachments) because we have some unknown macros in those pages. These pages seem to get re-migrated again if we update any plugin, enable/re-enable plugins followed by a restart.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is polluting the change history of the pages because it adds another version on each page. It also appears that the attachments on those pages are getting re-indexed.&#xd;
&#xd;
I understand the fix may have been intentional but it's having some bad side-effects.&#xd;
&#xd;

 * CONF-35185&#xd;
 * CONF-32837&#xd;
 * -CONF-32318-&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Set up a Confluence instance with the new affected versions.&#xd;
 * Create a new page with *Unmigrated-wiki-markup* macro as shown below or monitor an existing page with it.&#xd;
 ** Create a new page and in a Confluence editor > add `{*}Markup{*}`&#xd;
 ** Choose `{*}Confluence wiki{*}` and insert the below content; notice there are *some whitespaces* in the front of the closing curly bracket.You can see the Preview render a `{*}Wiki Markup{*}` macro  &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{&#xd;
   " "&#xd;
  } {code}&#xd;
!insertmarkup.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
 ** Click the `{*}Insert{*}` button and save the page. This will add an *unmigrated-wiki-markup* macro is added to the page. !umigratedwikimarkup.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 * Install/upgrade a third-party app that provides macros. Such as the Content Formatting for Confluence plugin version 7.2.4.&#xd;
 * Restart the instance.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No unexpected messages displayed in the UI or application logs and no new, unnecessary versions created.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
See notes below.&#xd;
h3. Notes on re-opening the bug&#xd;
&#xd;
When this issue occurs, one or two symptoms will be present:&#xd;

&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
A workaround has been added to the description of related ticket CONF-32837, which provides a method via SQL to disable the remigration job on restarts. As with all database manipulation tasks, please be sure to test this on a non-Production environment first.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the release of 5.10.8, a system variable is added to turn off the remigration behavior during startup. To use this feature:&#xd;
 # Open CONF_INSTALL_FOLDER/bin/setenv.sh (setenv.bat or service under Windows)&#xd;
 # Locate "CATALINA_OPTS" and add the below line to the file:&#xd;
CATALINA_OPTS="-Dconfluence.startup.remigration.disable=true ${CATALINA_OPTS}"&#xd;
 # Save the file and restart Tomcat.&#xd;
&#xd;
(i) This workaround has been verified to work for Confluence 9.x and would need to be present in the setenv file prior to the first restart of Confluence after an upgrade.</description><createDate>2015-05-29T17:39:19.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The migration code triggers when a plugin with a xhtml-macro is installed, in case it used to only be a regular wikimarkup macro, or in case that macro wasn't present at all, but now is.&#xd;
&#xd;
We can make the code a lot smarter about how it chooses what content to migrate, and which macro installs should trigger it. This can include:&#xd;
* if we're doing a plugin upgrade, and the old version had xhtml-macro "foo", and the new version has xhtml-macro "foo", then don't migrate anything&#xd;
* if we're doing a plugin upgrade, and the old version had wikimarkup macro "foo", and the new version has xhtml-macro "foo" - check (via the search index) if there are any usages of "foo" in unmigrated content. If there are none, then don't migrate anything&#xd;
* if we're doing a plugin upgrade, and the old version didn't have any macros, but the new version has xhtml-macro "foo" - check (via the search index) if there are any usages of "foo" in unmigrated content. If there are none, then don't migrate anything&#xd;
&#xd;
We can also be smarter about whether we store a new version of a page when migrating. If we didn't actually change anything, then we shouldn't store the new version. Note that as of Confluence 5.8, we inject a macroId into the content for each xhtml-macro, so any check for changes to save will need to ignore that. There is also a known issue around remigration inserting redundant empty paragraphs around block-level macros that can ruin padding on some tables and comments (or any place where we don't do a great job of collapsing adjacent newlines) - any fix should address this issue as well.</text><author>Richard Atkins</author></comments><comments><text>A workaround has been added to the description of related ticket CONF-32837, which provides a method via SQL to disable the remigration job on restarts.

In 5.3.x, PAGEID column should be replaced with CONTENTID instead in NOTIFICATIONS table but for this case somehow both columns exist and the value in CONTENTID column is all NULL. Somehow the migration task did not migrate PAGEID data in NOTIFICATIONS table to CONTENTID column.&#xd;
&#xd;
This has caused three different issues so far:&#xd;
# Unable to purge a trash or any trash at all. The issue occurred after an upgrade to 5.3.x and the following appears in the atlassian-confluence.log:&#xd;

When you look into the NOTIFICATIONS table, the watch notifications were listed there and they were tied to the correct usernames. However they were referencing to PAGEID instead of CONTENTID. CONTENTID is all NULL instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Resolution:&#xd;
All of the above can be fixed by implementing the steps below:&#xd;
# Stop Confluence&#xd;
# Backup Confluence database and Home Directory.&#xd;
# Run the following SQL query to copy the PAGEID values into the CONTENTID column&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
UPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET CONTENTID = PAGEID WHERE PAGEID IS NOT NULL;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Run the following query to drop the PAGEID Foreign Key constraint (double check the actual key name in the NOTIFICATIONS table)&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
ALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP FK594ACC88C38FBEA;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Run query to drop the index on the PAGEID column&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
drop index NOTIFICATIONS.n_pageid_idx;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Run this query to drop the actual PAGEID column&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
ALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP COLUMN PAGEID;&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Start Confluence&#xd;
# You should now be able to purge the trash, able to successfully delete any space and the page watchers are listed in Watch > Manage Watchers&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h5. Important note:&#xd;
The original bug in the upgrade task has been fixed. This means customers upgrading from Confluence versions lower then 5.3 to 5.4.4+ should no longer be effected by this.  &#xd;
&#xd;
However if you have previously upgraded from an older version of Confluence and are effected by this problem upgrading again to Confluence 5.4.4+ will NOT rerun the upgrade task. Therefore for customers in this situation it is still necessary to run the workaround, upgrading alone is not sufficient to fix this problem.</description><createDate>2015-03-06T00:24:02.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Task sorting by completed date not working</summary><key>CONFSERVER-35831</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-35831</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>When you go to your profile and choose tasks, you should be able to order your task list by 'Completed on' date.

h5.Environment: &#xd;
Confluence 5.4.3, Confluence 5.4.4&#xd;
JIRA 6.3.7&#xd;
&#xd;
h5.Steps to reproduce&#xd;
# Create an application link between JIRA and Confluence&#xd;
# In JIRA, create a scrum project, that has at least one epic in it.&#xd;
# In Confluence, create a page with the "Page Properties Macro".&#xd;
# Give this page a label of "Report"&#xd;
# Insert a table with one row, one heading column and one body column. Set the header to "Epic" and insert a JIRA link to the epic you created.&#xd;
# Duplicate this page 25-30 times&#xd;
# Create a new page, and insert the "Page Properties Report" macro&#xd;
## Enter "report" as the label&#xd;
## Enter "epic" as a field to be displayed&#xd;
## Save the report page and refresh&#xd;
&#xd;
h5.Expected Results&#xd;
The page should be displayed as quickly since issues from JIRA should be batched (as per https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31899)&#xd;
&#xd;
Displaying lots of JIRA issues on a page isn't a problem - a dozen or so issues on a single macro, displayed 3-4 times on a single page loads almost instantly.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5.Actual Results&#xd;
The page properties report macro can take a noticeably longer period of time to load. The performance problem can be exacerbated by higher usage in a production environment.&#xd;
&#xd;
h5.Workaround&#xd;
Remove any fields containing a JIRA macro from the page properties report macro. This will at least return performance to normal.&#xd;
&#xd;
Additionally, performance appears to be a little better in newer versions of Confluence, but can still be a problem in a loaded production environment.</description><createDate>2014-11-11T00:47:02.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This can be a very big problem if the page properties macro contains a JIRA filter... such as a JIRA filter macro that returns the count of issues in the filter.&#xd;
&#xd;
We recently had a page properties report that rolled up 33 pages that used the page properties macro. Each macro contained a JIRA filter macro that returned a count of issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
The page properties report caused the page to take anywhere between 20-60 seconds to load (even though the report macro was paged).</text><author>Chad Barnes</author></comments><comments><text>Here is Confluence 5.7.1. and run across this issue. &#xd;
&#xd;
Removing the fields with a JIRA issue macro is not an option here, since the reports are all about projects that are managed in JIRA.</text><author>Adolfo Casari</author></comments><comments><text>I too am making a summary report in wiki about projects managed in JIRA.  For each project, I have a templated subpage in wiki where a JIRA Epic can be associated in the header (page properties macro).&#xd;

Page Properties Report macro SORTing doen't seem to work in a predictable manner -- I have a column containing JIRA issues in it.  I was hoping to see 'Epics' that are 'in progress' at the top and 'closed' further down (and rows missing jira tasks at the bottom). </text><author>Jeremy Chambers</author></comments><comments><text>We sue the page properties report with combination of the Jira macro intensively and it creates a big issue for use, user don't want to use it.

When creating a new page, or copying a existing one&#xd;
&#xd;
+Repro Steps:+&#xd;
* For a new page:&#xd;
*# Create a new page.&#xd;
*# Add some content, including links to pages in the same space.&#xd;
*# Click on the _Location_ button and change the location of the page to another space.&#xd;
*# Save the page.&#xd;
* For an existing page&#xd;
*# Visualize a page with links to other pages.&#xd;
*# Click on _Tools_ > _Copy_.&#xd;
*# Click on the _Location_ button and change the location of the page to another space.&#xd;
*# Save the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
In both cases, the links to the pages are broken and they lead you to the creation of a new page with the same title than the one specified for the link.&#xd;
&#xd;
I would expect Confluence to update the links to pages when changing the location of a page. This is what happens when you click on the _Move_ button.</description><createDate>2014-09-30T15:09:50.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The error also affected 6.15.1 version</text><author>Pavel Afanasev</author></comments><comments><text>Issue still present 26/11/2023 (Confluence verision 1000.0.0-2e59beab1614)</text><author>Eugenio Mauri</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Links to pages and anchors are broken after Space/Page export to Word doc</summary><key>CONFSERVER-33872</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-33872</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}&#xd;

h2. Summary&#xd;
When exporting Spaces or Pages to word doc format, the links inside the exported document file are broken&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Issue 1 in a Page Export to Word&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a page in Confluence with a lot of contents&#xd;
# Create a heading in the bottom of the page and an [anchor|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/anchor-macro-724765159.html] or [link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/insert-links-and-anchors-724764900.html#InsertLinksandAnchors-Linktoaheadingonapage] to the other heading in the top part of the page&#xd;
 !CONFSERVER-33872-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
# Save, ensure that the link/anchor works in Confluence&#xd;
# Export to word&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The exported page should contain working anchor links&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The anchor links does not work in Word.&#xd;
 !CONFSERVER-33872-2.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
 &#xd;
h2. Issue 2 - Space Export to Word&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create a new space with a few new pages.&#xd;
# Insert a link macro on one of the pages and link it to one of the other pages inside the space&#xd;
# Export the page to word doc&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The exported pages [^lalalala.doc]  should contain working links&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The links does not work in Word.&#xd;
For example, the link that inside the page supposed to be {{http://confluence-pc:5410/confluence/display/PDF/page1}} but shown as below instead&#xd;

This is NOT a minor bug to me, neither for any user. It makes PDF and Word Documents exported beeing unusable!&#xd;

&#xd;
* Something as fundamental as internal links being wrong on every single page makes the *Export to Word* unusable. &#xd;
* As this has been outstanding for over 2 years, and is likely to affect nearly every single page exported anywhere, it's a poor reflection on confluence as a product.&#xd;
* It would be better to remove (or hide) the option to *Export to Word* in confluence until this is fixed, or at the very least make it clear within [ExportingContenttoWord,PDF,HTMLandXML-ExportsinglepagestoWordorPDF|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf57/exporting-content-to-word-pdf-html-and-xml-701435210.html#ExportingContenttoWord,PDF,HTMLandXML-ExportsinglepagestoWordorPDF] that this is broken.&#xd;
* Is Atlassian actually committed to supporting the *Export to Word* functionality?</text><author>Alfa Product Team</author></comments><comments><text>I fully agree, this issue is not minor, its huge. It prevents me from creating important documents.&#xd;

1. Put together search query that is longer than 256 characters&#xd;
2. Search Confluence with your query .../dosearchsite.action?where=TEST&amp;type=page&amp;queryString=...&#xd;
&#xd;
Expected behavior:&#xd;
found pages (or at least if search is somehow limited inform user about this limit by some kind of warning message...)&#xd;

What happened instead:&#xd;
No results found&#xd;

For us this is a SHOW STOPPER in the ability for our company to upgrade and continue to use Confluence. It seems like the fix should be trivial.&#xd;

&#xd;
It's causing a serious problem with our plans to upgrade from Confluence 4.x to 5.x - it simply breaks our search.&#xd;
&#xd;
See the attached screenshot. All of those search areas on the left are spaces. Our search filter breaks due to the character limitation. &#xd;
&#xd;
I tried to update *confluence/decorators/search.vmd* to use *post* instead of *get* but that doesn't seem to help.&#xd;
&#xd;
Anyone from R&amp;D with authoritative comments on this issue? Thanks.&#xd;

&#xd;
You can search using REST and CQL with no practical limit on the spaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, this will work:&#xd;
&#xd;
*http://your.site.com/rest/api/content/search?os_username=&lt;USER NAME>&amp;os_password=&lt;USER PWD>&amp;cql=(type=page and text ~Nodelocked and space in (eesofkcads,eesofkcalfna,eesofkcama,eesofkcempro,ads201501,ads201401,ads201306,ads2012,ads2011,ads201101,ads2009U1,ads2009,ads2008U2,support))*&#xd;
&#xd;
...where &lt;USER NAME> and &lt;USER PWD> are proper login permissions. The authentication is needed if doing a search from a script (like Python etc.). &#xd;
&#xd;
The only issue I now have is that the search results don't return a 'summary' view. At least search does work with this method - I can workaround the summary issue.&#xd;

  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-31528].&#xd;
  {panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
Space XML imports will sometimes fail due to a variety of reasons:&#xd;
* Confluence runs out of memory&#xd;
* The import process times out&#xd;
* Unique key constraint violations&#xd;
* A few other causes are described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+XML+backups+that+fail+on+restore&#xd;
&#xd;
Oftentimes these partially imported spaces remain in the DB without any way to remove them via the UI, making a re-import attempt impossible (due to a duplicate Space Key or other constraint violation).&#xd;
&#xd;
Can we investigate:&#xd;
- some way to rollback a failed XML space import (or determine whether imports will fail before it starts)?&#xd;
- possibilities for Confluence to automatically recognise half-imported Spaces and delete related data from the UI?&#xd;
&#xd;

Thanks for re-raising this issue. Could you help me understand why the space import is breaking in the first place. I think it would be better to treat the cause of this issue if possible rather that try to resolve the symptoms.&#xd;

Regards</text><author>Steve Haffenden</author></comments><comments><text>This is also an issue when exporting a space with only specific selected pages from v-5.8.18 to v-5.10.7.&#xd;
&#xd;
First I made an export of the full space, without problems (only the issues with "Undexpected EOF in CDATA section"[1]), and deleted it. Then I tried to export the space with only 1 selected page and imported that. This import also went fine, but when I deleted the space again it seems like it wasn't able to delete everything. When I for the second time imported the same export, I was not able to import it due constraint violation.&#xd;

At this point I'm probably better just nuking the entire thing and rebuilding from scratch.&#xd;

 I was running a Postgres database so followed the Postgres instructions section.&#xd;
 The bulk query failed as per above with the foreign key constraint.&#xd;
&#xd;
I ran each statement individually and this is what it was getting hung up on:&#xd;
 _/* DELETE SPACE */_&#xd;
 _DELETE FROM spaces WHERE spaceid=SPACEID_HERE;_&#xd;
&#xd;
When you queried the "content" table with _SELECT * FROM content WHERE spaceid=1998852_ you still saw many remaining objects.&#xd;
 They seemed to mostly be attachment and page objects from what I can recall.&#xd;
&#xd;
I ended up just nuking the database and starting over to test again. &#xd;
 I did also test this with Confluence 6.2.1 which made no difference.&#xd;
 It doesn't seem to have anything to do with a failed import as I experienced the same results by doing the following:&#xd;
 # Full space XML export from our Atlassian Cloud Confluence instance&#xd;
 # Import space into Confluence Server 6.2.1 (Postgres) instance&#xd;
 # Attempt to delete space (fails)&#xd;
 # Attempt manual workaround (fails)&#xd;

</text><author>Minh Tran</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Minh, &#xd;
&#xd;
I have done this, and it was +*not*+ able to be resolved within our existing Confluence instance. I believe this is due to the database being an Amazon Web Services RDS Postgres database (where Amazon does not allow you to have 100% admin access so some commands cannot run).&#xd;
&#xd;
It sounds like the only solution at this time would be to export the entire Confluence instance out to another local server running a Postgres database where you do have full admin access, run the manual DB fix, then import it all back into the production AWS Server. For a production Confluence instance having to export/import and manually manipulate data directly at the database level is somewhat risky and not really an acceptable solution for a production environment in my opinion.</text><author>Mark Benson</author></comments><comments><text>Dear [~mark.benson1447742102],&#xd;

Atlassian</text><author>Minh Tran</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Atlassian,&#xd;
&#xd;
I currently have a problem with your work around.  We ran into this over the weekend and started to work with premier support.  However, there are policies in place to not support processes that do DB queries so we had to adjust midway and and go the restore route.  I'd like for Atlassian Development and Support to try and stay more in sync if possible.  &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
There are actually two issues here that I think are worth mentioning/addressing. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
1) Finding out what caused the corruption in this specific case. &#xd;
&#xd;
2) The problem I have where I ask for Atlassian to stay in sync.  &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
The first item - There was a support ticket that our TAM @mshelton can help get additional details if I miss anything.  Anyway, we ran into a case where the cloud instance had a project space and someone copied some pages from a personal space over to the project space where those pages still had links on them to the personal space.  The destination instance already had a personal space for said person so the project space failed to import and then failed to be deleted.  We tried to follow the steps above and ran into some errors where comments and page versions couldn't be deleted due to DB constraints.  I know this bug has been opened for a while, but it would be helpful if this could be addressed in a way to fail the import in a way that can be cleaned up, even if it can't do the import itself. &#xd;
&#xd;
The second item is more of an overall Atlassian issue.  I don't solely blame Premier Support.  They do an awesome job for us and handle all the crazy things we come up with.  What I am seeing is a disconnect between the Developer side of the house and the Support side of the house.  While I think that this is going to exist to some degree no matter what, it seems to be a bit more pronounced lately and specifically in cases like this one.  The Development side of the house is going to try to solve problems however they can, find work arounds, push new features.  And Support is going to be more cautious so they can scale too handle the large number of customers.  The problem for customers is when we are stuck in the middle between these suggestion paths and Atlassian Support not backing the Development team's documentation that is available to end users.  I'd like to see Atlassian Support try to endorse and help facilitate customers in following Developer suggestions.  All the same caveats can be in place that this is not to be taken lightly and should be done in sandbox/dev environments and at the customer's own risk, but it would help the customer experience to be a bit more consistent.  &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
I'm happy to have any one-on-one meetings to discuss further if it would help.  &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Regards,&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
I know that this is late relative to your comments, but you can still do this on RDS by outputting to standard output.&#xd;
I use PostgreSQL on RDS and was forced to employ this solution due to a failed import.&#xd;
&#xd;
What I did was put the SQL from [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/how-to-drop-and-recreate-the-database-constraints-on-postgresql-776812450.html] into two initial sql files.&#xd;
&#xd;
generate-drop-constraints.sql&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT 'ALTER TABLE '||nspname||'."'||relname||'" DROP CONSTRAINT "'||conname||'";'&#xd;
FROM pg_constraint&#xd;
INNER JOIN pg_class ON conrelid=pg_class.oid&#xd;
INNER JOIN pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid=pg_class.relnamespace&#xd;
ORDER BY CASE WHEN contype='f' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,contype,nspname,relname,conname&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
generate-recreate-constraints.sql&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
SELECT 'ALTER TABLE '||nspname||'."'||relname||'" ADD CONSTRAINT "'||conname||'" '|| pg_get_constraintdef(pg_constraint.oid)||';'&#xd;
FROM pg_constraint&#xd;
INNER JOIN pg_class ON conrelid=pg_class.oid&#xd;
INNER JOIN pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid=pg_class.relnamespace&#xd;
ORDER BY CASE WHEN contype='f' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END DESC,contype DESC,nspname DESC,relname DESC,conname DESC&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
Then I ran those two files and send the results to a file.&#xd;
&#xd;
{{/etc/alternatives/pgsql-psql --host=MYRDSHOST --port=5432 --username=MYDBUSER --dbname=MYDBNAME &lt; generate-drop-contraints.sql > drop-constraints.sql}}&#xd;
&#xd;
{{/etc/alternatives/pgsql-psql --host=MYRDSHOST --port=5432 --username=MYDBUSER --dbname=MYDBNAME &lt; generate-recreate-contraints.sql > recreate-constraints.sql}}&#xd;
&#xd;
Then, I can use the drop-constraints.sql and recreate-constraints.sql file to do their job and drop/recreate the constraints.&#xd;
&#xd;
Now I only have to figure out how to get my space import to work...&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks,&#xd;

It has been a nightmare since we have experienced this issue and now we are holding back on importing any spaces from our other instances. I am pretty sure all a lot of other users/customers are experiencing the same. &#xd;

No, I am not claiming every tool is amazingly perfect and you can prevent corruption 100% of the time, I'm not disillusioned to think apps never crash, no bugs exist ever.

Problem&#xd;
* Links to an anchor in a Confluence page of another space are broken when they are edited.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Select the text that you want to link&#xd;
# Click _Insert >> Link_, and go to _Advanced_ tab&#xd;
# In the Advanced tab, configure the link to point to an anchor in another page using this format:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
SPACEKEY:PageName#AnchorName&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
# Save the link and the page.&#xd;
# Click the link.&#xd;
# Return to the page you edited and re-edit the link.&#xd;
# Save the link *without making any changes* and save the page.&#xd;
# Click the link.&#xd;
# Return to the page you edited and attempt to re-edit the link.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Both times it is clicked, the link should take you to the correct destination page and scroll to the anchor.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* The link only works the first time.&#xd;
* When you return and edit the link, the "SPACKEY:" prefix is removed without notice. The link becomes:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
PageName#AnchorName&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
* When this problem occurs, clicking the link takes you to a Create view to create a page with that name in the current space.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
On the first edit the link configuration appears to be correct in the source markup:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;ac:link ac:anchor="ANCHORNAME">&#xd;
    &lt;ri:page ri:content-title="PAGETITLE" ri:space-key="SPACKEY"/>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:plain-text-link-body>&lt;![CDATA[LINKTEXT]]&gt;&lt;/ac:plain-text-link-body>&#xd;
&lt;/ac:link>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
When editing the second time the source markup is unchanged, but in the Edit dialog the space prefix is removed:&#xd;
!spacekey-removed-from-link.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
After the second edit the {{ri:space-key}} parameter is dropped.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;ac:link>&#xd;
    &lt;ri:page ri:content-title="Disabling and enabling apps"/>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:plain-text-link-body>&lt;![CDATA[enable safe mode]]&gt;&lt;/ac:plain-text-link-body>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The original reporter also noted, "It used to be uneditable prior to 4.3.6, as it was fixed in that version."&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Use the "Web Link" option instead and paste in the absolute/static URL, e.g. http(s)://HOST/SPACEKEY/PAGE#ANCHOR&#xd;
&#xd;
NOTE: This link breaks if the name or space of the target page is changed.&#xd;

&#xd;
It's a real annoyance because it makes it _really_ easy to break links.  If you just click on the link to Edit it, (e.g. to change the displayed text) but don't make any change to the actual link itself, when you click Save, you've just broken the link.  &#xd;
&#xd;
And since you can't edit broken links, you have to start over.</text><author>Fred Bunting</author></comments><comments><text>We've run into the same problem (Confluence 5.4.4).&#xd;

h3. Summary of The Bug&#xd;
&#xd;
When page title have any character after a colon( : )&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Office Connector:test&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
office connector can't find the office files attached to the page. If colon is the last character on the page title, attached office files searchable by view office macro.&#xd;
&#xd;
This bug also affects the multimedia macros (adding audio / video files).&#xd;
h3. How to reproduce the bug&#xd;
 # Create a page (example: 'Office connector:')&#xd;
 !Officepage.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Attached office file into the page&#xd;
 !attached.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Try to view it using view office plugin&#xd;
 !Works.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Change the page title to contain any character after colon (example: 'Office connector:test')&#xd;
 !test.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Try to view it using view office plugin&#xd;
 !broke.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 # Attached files can't be seen on "File Name" fields&#xd;
 (i) When viewed with _Developer Tools_, the {{attachmentsearch.action}} GET request returned HTTP 404 error code.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workarounds&#xd;
&#xd;
Option 1 - Rename the page to remove the ':'&#xd;
&#xd;
Option 2 - Use the insert markup feature:&#xd;
 # From the editor toolbar, expand the '+' menu.&#xd;
 # Choose 'Markup'.&#xd;
 # Insert the following markup (change accordingly):&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{viewfile:name_of_the_attachments.ext}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Save&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-32856&#xd;
&#xd;
The idea is that Confluence admins would have an option to disallow WebDAV-problematic characters in page titles, which would prevent WebDAV problems. Users would see a friendly error message if they tried to save a page title with the disallowed characters. Existing content would not be affected until someone went to edit the page title.&#xd;
&#xd;
Also, CONF-32856 includes an awesome mockup screenshot which is worth a vote on its own, if I do say so myself. &#xd;

&#xd;
we have now added the following "fix" to the confluence Custom-HTML-Section:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;script>&#xd;
$( document ).ajaxComplete(function() {&#xd;
  var elem=$('#macro-param-page');&#xd;
  if (elem.val()===undefined)&#xd;
    return;&#xd;
  if (elem.val().indexOf(":")>0){&#xd;
    $('#macro-param-page').val("");&#xd;
    $('#macro-param-page').change();&#xd;
  }&#xd;
});&#xd;
&lt;/script>{code}&#xd;
It will auto-apply a workaround, by removing the page-title from the parameterized attachment search.&#xd;
 This way the search will be issued for the current page.&#xd;
 So this will cover 95% of the cases where the issue is happening.&#xd;
&#xd;
The only thing not possibly is embedding an attachment from another page in the space, when this has a colon in it...&#xd;
 But this will be negligible.&#xd;
&#xd;
Best regards,&#xd;
 Tobias</text><author>Tobias Twardon</author></comments><comments><text>The above workaround is appreciated.  I see the priority was also moved to "High"... does this suggest the workaround, or even better a fix, will be rolled into release?  &#xd;
&#xd;
Cheers</text><author>Malcolm Cook</author></comments><comments><text>This issue produces 2 more problems, besides the viewfile-macro-thing:&#xd;
 * the linking to a page fails, if it contains an anchor&#xd;
 * when a user makes changes on a page, but does not save/publish them, they are temporary saved. When he later goes in edit-mode again, he is offered to use these changes.&#xd;
But when another user in the meantime changes the page name with special characters (so that the URL changes from title to ID), then the first user can get an erorr message, and the whole content is gone.&#xd;
&#xd;
And see https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/14/CSP-220512: only my case bound a lot of ressources (also in your support team). This time is better used for fixing!&#xd;

&#xd;
It's not clear which operation can cause the duplicate, the current suspicion is this was due to an xml import or certain plugin operations can cause this.&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
CREATE&#xd;
    TABLE content_label&#xd;
    (&#xd;
        id BIGINT NOT NULL,&#xd;
        labelid BIGINT NOT NULL,&#xd;
        contentid BIGINT NOT NULL,&#xd;
        owner CHARACTER VARYING(255),&#xd;
        creationdate TIMESTAMP(6) WITHOUT TIME ZONE,&#xd;
        lastmoddate TIMESTAMP(6) WITHOUT TIME ZONE,&#xd;
        PRIMARY KEY (id),&#xd;
        CONSTRAINT fkf0e7436e27072aef FOREIGN KEY (labelid) REFERENCES label (labelid),&#xd;
        CONSTRAINT fkf0e7436e8dd41734 FOREIGN KEY (contentid) REFERENCES content (contentid)&#xd;
    )&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
As can be seen from the DDL, the CONTENT_LABEL table currently owns two contraints in {{contentid}} and {{labelid}} columns, but perhaps we should make them into a combined constraint. So both the labelid and contentid must be unique for each row.&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
Following from existing issue ([CONFCLOUD-58589|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-58589])&#xd;
&#xd;
Current work around is to select the line above and below to allow pasting data from one table to another with the same cell format, and not pasting table nested within the select cell.&#xd;
&#xd;
This only appears to work on new tables and not existing tables with formatting already applied. Looking at the storage format, I can see the difference between these two is when &lt;td> is used the paste functionality works as expected. But when &lt;th> is used, it follows the same undesired functionality&#xd;

vs&#xd;
&lt;td colspan="1">&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence Cloud&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Create a table with popluated data, publish page, then attempt to use the work around (as outlined in CONFCLOUD-58589) to copy cells from another table. (with selecting line above and below source table)&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Cell format and data should be pasted following cell structure from source table, as is the case when pasting into a new table&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Cell data is pasted within the selected cell as a nested table&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
_previous work around only applies to new tables_&#xd;

 * There is no "Status" option in the pop-up&#xd;
!Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 2.59.49 PM.png|width=526,height=79!&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When running a space restore from a backup created with "Rewind Backups for Confluence", if one of the space page's body has invalid content, the process will fail due an error with the "Create page" API used by the app&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Install the "Rewind Backups for Confluence" app&#xd;
# Create a new space&#xd;
# Create a new page with the following storage format&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&lt;h1>Test page&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"children\" ac:schema-version=\"2\" data-layout=\"default\" ac:local-id=\"212382fd-825c-40c9-8ecf-9d514fb9680b\" ac:macro-id=\"c3a78d51c5c10b66f2f66f08c69b69b96596db6be3d348cda6f6e493cecdfc91\">&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"depth\">2&lt;/ac:parameter>&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"allChildren\">true&lt;/ac:parameter>&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"style\" />&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"page\">&lt;ac:link />&lt;/ac:parameter>&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"sortAndReverse\" />&lt;ac:parameter ac:name=\"first\">0&lt;/ac:parameter>&lt;/ac:structured-macro>&lt;/p>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Create a couple of pages under it&#xd;
# Run the Rewind backup for the space you just created&#xd;
# Delete the space&#xd;
# Trigger a space restore through Rewind&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The space is restored from the backup, with all pages&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The space restore will fail due to an issue while recreating the pages using the "Create page" API:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
{&#xd;
    "errors": [&#xd;
        {&#xd;
            "status": 500,&#xd;
            "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",&#xd;
            "title": "Internal Server Error",&#xd;
            "detail": null&#xd;
        }&#xd;
    ]&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The process fails as the page's body has invalid parameters for the Children Display macro. This was the example we encountered so far, but it can happen with other elements the API won't process.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
There is a display issue with the status macro when used in headings within live-docs. When the status macro is edited, the table of contents (TOC) reflects an altered display where the status macro appears outlined in the status color but lacks the filled color.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue also happens with regular pages, but it gets automatically fixed after the page is published&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is specifically problematic for live-docs, as these documents are not published, and thus the display issue persists. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a page or live-doc and insert a heading with a status macro.&#xd;
 # Add the table of contents macro.&#xd;
 # Edit the status macro within the heading.&#xd;
 # Observe the table of contents display, where the status macro's filled color is missing, showing only an outline.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The status macro should display correctly with the filled color in the table of contents, even after editing, without needing to publish the page.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The status macro in the table of contents changes to an outlined version without the filled color, and this persists in live-docs.&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2025-04-01-17-45-30-054.png!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
A temporary workaround involves converting the live-doc to a regular page and then reverting it to live edit mode.</description><createDate>2025-04-01T20:44:37.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Unable to Add or remove labels in Confluence cloud page</summary><key>CONFCLOUD-81286</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-81286</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

We have noticed an issue where the spacing between images in Confluence Cloud is not behaving as expected. The images are not spaced consistently, which may affect the layout and readability of pages.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new Confluence page or open an existing one.&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The images should have consistent and appropriate spacing between them, as per the default page layout or user-configured settings. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In some scenarios, space keys do not match the space alias. In such spaces, some linking functionalities in Confluence do not work properly. In order to verify if the space key matches with the alias, the REST API can be used:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://instance.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/space/{spaceKey}{code}&#xd;
The result would then show something similar to below, where the "key" is different to the "alias":&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
id: 1000,&#xd;
key: "TEST",&#xd;
alias: "alias",&#xd;
name: "Test Space",&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
In Confluence Cloud editor, the page experiences erratic jumping behavior when editing a page that includes the Table of Contents (TOC) macro. This issue occurs exclusively in the Safari browser and is not present in Chrome or Firefox. Removing the TOC macro resolves the issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Open Confluence Cloud in the Safari browser.&#xd;
# Create or open a page with multiple headings.&#xd;
# Insert the Table of Contents macro to the page.&#xd;
# Begin editing the page content below the headings at the bottom or anywhere in between the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The page intermittently jumps or shifts position during editing, disrupting the editing process.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The page should remain stable during editing, with no unexpected jumps or shifts, regardless of the presence of the TOC macro.&#xd;
The below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When filtering a Confluence Database for a tag field being empty or non-empty, it treats empty tag fields as not being empty if they have *ever* had a value.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a database that has a field with the tag type.&#xd;
 # Fill in some of the fields with tags and notate which ones have ever had tags.&#xd;
 # remove all tags from at least one row that has had a tag.&#xd;
 # create a filter, and filter for the tag field for "is not empty"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Only rows with values in the field show up&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Any rows that have *ever* had a value, including those that no longer have any values will show up instead.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently, the only workaround is to create new rows and copy all other fields into the row to make the field for that row "empty" again, or to filter for all possible values.</description><createDate>2025-03-28T18:26:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Spoke with [~jlong@atlassian.com] via Slack.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
An inaccurate textual description "Custom logo" is specified for the "CG Logo" image link.&#xd;
h3. Note:&#xd;
&#xd;
To resolve the current bug, it is necessary to implement a feature that enables administrators to add alt text for the custom logo. This functionality should be flexible enough to allow admins to customize the alt text according to their organization's specific requirements.&#xd;
&#xd;
Feature Request Link: [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-81193]&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open the Confluence Cloud instance with custom logo present.&#xd;
 # Using a screen reader, navigate to the mentioned image link in the header section.&#xd;
 # Listen that the textual description is not describing the functionality of the image link.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Screen Recording&#xd;
&#xd;
[^Inaccurate Alt Text.mp4]&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When screen reader users navigate through the header section in Confluence, the "CG Logo" informative image link is announced as "Custom logo", which does not accurately convey the information visually represented by the image.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue occurs because inaccurate alt text has been provided in the "alt" attribute.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, this creates a poor experience for screen reader users.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Ensure that the accurate textual description of the image is read out by the screen reader.&#xd;
&#xd;
Apply the following changes:&#xd;
 * Provide an appropriate and accurate textual description for the informative image.&#xd;
 * Ensure that the textual description accurately reflects the purpose of the image.&#xd;
 * In this case, ensure that the textual description for the mentioned image link is "CG Confluence Homepage".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Code Snippet:&#xd;
&#xd;
*Syntax:* &lt;img src="..." alt="ClientName_ ProductName_Homepage">&#xd;
&#xd;
*Correct code Example:*&#xd;
&#xd;
&lt;a href="/wiki" data-testid="app-navigation-custom-wordmark">&#xd;

&#xd;
The Legacy macro in Jira issues interprets text within curly braces '{}' in issue descriptions as special values. This interpretation causes table rows containing '{}' to collapse into a single row, which distorts the table data format.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create an issue in Jira and feed the description filed with the table&#xd;
 # Fill out rows with data containing '{}'. like API calls with variables included. e.g. POST questions-list/questionnaire/v2/\{questionnaire-responses}/123&#xd;
 # Use Jira legacy macro on Confluence Cloud and include a description field as well.&#xd;
 # Then publish the Confluence page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Similar to [CONFCLOUD-80466|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-80466#], when the correct custom field is using global context and there are duplicated custom fields with context defined to other Projects, the column is not populated. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Since Confluence Analytics numbers are based on events triggered by actions taken on pages (creation, updates, etc.), on a few specific occasions, those events may either be duplicated or missed, resulting in discrepancies between the actual number of pages created by a user and what is displayed within Analytics screens.&#xd;
&#xd;
The discrepancies may be either bigger (potential duplicate events) or lower (potential missed events) numbers than the actual value.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
So far we have not been able to reproduce the issue consistently, but already gathered multiple case examples for analysis.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Numbers matching between DB queries and Analytics&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Discrepancies between the number of pages created in DB vs Analytics&#xd;

&#xd;
https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/488135/Nameless%20button&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user navigates to the "Restriction" icon button on any published Confluence page, it is missing an accessible name and is announced only as "button". This issue occurs exclusively in the iOS mobile app when navigating with the VoiceOver screen reader.&#xd;
As a result, VoiceOver screen reader users are unable to effectively understand the purpose of the button.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The "Restriction" icon button should have an accessible name that is clearly communicated to screen reader users. This name should be both unique and sufficiently descriptive to convey the button's function effectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
For further guidance on accessibility best practices, refer to the following resources:&#xd;

And finally there are several third party vendors that rely on page and version metadata to manage content, including Midori Better Archiving, B1NARY Breeze Content Management, Bordant's Automatic Archiving, Ricksoft's Pages Manager... likely others.&#xd;

Are you sure that overwriting the version metadata is currently _correctly_ set at such a Low priority and Minor Sev? /cc @[lmehrkens@atlassian.com|mailto:lmehrkens@atlassian.com] @[mtse@atlassian.com|mailto:mtse@atlassian.com] </text><author>Nick Wade -Opus Guard-</author></comments><comments><text>Checking back in a month on.

Affected customers would be any Confluence Cloud customer site that has ever called Archive Page more than 0 times. This seems likely to be a lot. &#xd;

When attempting to manage Watchers from a Space, if there are a large amount of Watchers on the Space the UI element can time out and throw a generic error. &#xd;

Problem&#xd;
&#xd;
In Confluence Cloud, when a user lacks permissions to add or delete attachments in a space, they cannot upload files while editing a page. The editor menu bar option for "Add Image, Video or file" is not visible.&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) However, when using the shortcut (/image) in the editor, the option appears but fails to function, leading to user confusion.&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence Cloud&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Ensure the user does not have permission to add or delete attachments in a space.&#xd;
 # Open a page in edit mode.&#xd;
 # Attempt to add an image via the editor menu bar (option is not available).&#xd;
 # Use the /image shortcut to add an image.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user without attachment permissions attempts to add an image using the shortcut, they should receive a warning about their lack of permissions, or the shortcut should not be available.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The shortcut option appears, and users can attempt to add an image, but the action fails without any warning, causing confusion.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no workaround available; Users need to be informed about their permissions before attempting to use the shortcut.&#xd;
h3. Notes&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue causes confusion for users who are unaware of their permission limitations. Enhancing the user interface to prevent the appearance of the shortcut, or providing a clear warning message, *would improve the user experience.*</description><createDate>2025-02-04T16:35:38.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Unable to edit gadgets - the preview is showing blank with no options to edit</summary><key>CONFCLOUD-80681</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-80681</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
The statements on this [page |https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/use-gadgets-to-add-dynamic-content/]are contradictory. On the one hand, it is written that the Jira gadgets will no longer be supported from 26.09.2022. However, the following sentence states that existing gadgets will continue to work and that new gadgets can also be added. &#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{panel:title=As of September 26, 2022, Confluence will no longer support Jira gadgets in Confluence. }&#xd;
Any existing instances of these gadgets will continue to work and be available to add to a Confluence page from the insert menu and using the slash command.&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
Now Atlassian has changed something so that the gadgets can no longer be edited, which makes them useless. My expectation is that if Atlassian breaks something, they will fix it or provide an equivalent alternative. Regardless of whether the support is there or not!&#xd;

If I can at least provide one workaround which is specifically for the {*}Jira Filter Results Gadget/Macro{*}. If you edit a confluence page and you paste the link to a Jira filter.

That being said. I have no clue if there's a way to use "smartlinks" to get the equivalent for all the various other gadgets like 2D Charts, average resolution time, pie charts, and all of that.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
There are Jira issue macros with URLs such as&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
&lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name="jiraissues" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="ca8f02ed-018d-43c6-a8da-xxxxxxxxxxxx">&#xd;
    &lt;ac:parameter ac:name="cache">off&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:parameter ac:name="count">true&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:parameter ac:name="title">Umgesetzte &amp;Auml;nderungen&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:parameter ac:name="url">&lt;ri:url ri:value="https://{cloud-url}.atlassian.net/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/21119/SearchRequest-21119.xml?tempMax=1000" />&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
    &lt;ac:parameter ac:name="height">250&lt;/ac:parameter>&#xd;
&lt;/ac:structured-macro>&#xd;
&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Even after updating the base URL as you can see in the above metadata, the macros is still not fixed.&#xd;
h3. Observation&#xd;
&#xd;
When visiting the partially fixed link from the storage format&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://{cloud-site}.atlassian.net/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/21119/SearchRequest-21119.xml?tempMax=1000{code}&#xd;
We get an "XSRF Security Token Missing", this may be due to an OAuth error. In Jira and Confluence Cloud, we regularly run health checks to ensure that the OAuth connection is secure. Any time Jira searches are run from outside Jira (Confluence is outside Jira), then a valid, non-expired token is required. To replicate, if we go to:&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
> https://{cloud-site}.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=21119&#xd;
> Then click "Export" (top right corner)&#xd;
> Then click "Export XML", and then we'll see a valid search.&#xd;
> If we inspect the URL bar, you will see:&#xd;
> https://{cloud-site}.atlassian.net/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/21119/SearchRequest-21119.xml?atl_token=549xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx48_lin&amp;tempMax=1000{noformat}&#xd;
The addition of an "atl_token" parameter. This is missing from the Jira issue macro in Confluence - it is not able to perform an authenticated valid search as it is missing a token.&#xd;
h3. Next Steps:&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no known workaround.</description><createDate>2025-01-23T08:44:41.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi [~802848781776],&#xd;

The root cause is most likely that the customer is using the legacy XML endpoint as the search URL. Please try changing it to the REST API endpoint.  &#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
&#xd;
The so called legacy XML endpoint is also used when someone goes to Jira search and click on Export as XML, etc. If the jiraissues marco itself would work (without converting it as jira macro instead) just with another url, what's the url that should be used instead?&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
 * Smart value "{{{}page.url{}}}" can be used in Confluence automation&#xd;
 * custom domains can be configured to provide a custom URL to access Confluence sites. For [https://example|https://example/] wiki.confluence.example.com/wiki can be configured for site [https://example.atlassian.net/wiki]&#xd;
 * When the above smart value is used in Confluence automation its printing wrong URL as [https://wiki.confluence.example.com/spaces/EXCEL/pages/281739275] rather than [https://wiki.confluence.example.com/wiki/spaces/EXCEL/pages/281739275]&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: NA&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Prerequisite:&#xd;
 * Confluence automation rule that generates the value using smart value "{{{}page.url"{}}}&#xd;
 * A site with custom URL configured for Confluence Cloud.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Deleting a space causes the automation rule's scope to change from single space to global.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create an automation rule and set its scope to a *single space*&#xd;
# Set the trigger to *Scheduled*;&#xd;
# Add a *Page branch*, example: Last updated more than 5 months ago;&#xd;
# Add the *Send email* action to something like this: "This is a reminder to update your content titled '{{page.title}}' at {{page.url}}. It has not been updated in the last 5 months.";&#xd;
# Turn on the rule and wait for it to run on its schedule.&#xd;
-- You should receive an email with pages matching the criteria you set in step 3, only pages from a single space.&#xd;
# *Delete the space* where the rule is;&#xd;
# Wait for the rule to run on its next schedule.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The automation rule shouldn't run(as the space is deleted) or its scope should remain on the single space you set.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The automation rule's scope is changed from single space to global and your *Page branch* criteria expands to all space, like a Global scope.&#xd;

User Problem&#xd;
# When a "user group" that's used for page restriction is deleted;&#xd;
** The restriction from the group still applies to the page.&#xd;
# The restriction does not show up in the Space's Restriction list&#xd;
** !Space_Restricted_Content.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
** Making it impossible for Space admins to even know that they exist, and how to fix them.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Add a page view restriction to a page in Confluence, making sure to add a "user group" into the list of exemption.&#xd;
# Proceed to delete the "user group" from the site's user/groups management.&#xd;
** {code:java}https://admin.atlassian.com/s/&lt;SITE-ID>/groups{code}&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Restricted pages should be listed in the Space's restricted pages list, with the option for Space admins to remove them.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
A column disappears unexpectedly in the Jira issue macro on Confluence pages if a Column is using a Jira custom field with duplicate name and different context.z&#xd;
We can observe that although the macro preview shows the correct value, the source code shows that *all custom fields with the same name have been selected for the same column.*&#xd;
For instance:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
properties":\{"columns":&#xd;
[\{"key":"issuetype"\},&#xd;
\{"key":"key"\},&#xd;
\{"key":"summary"\},&#xd;
\{"key":"status"\},&#xd;
\{"key":"resolutiondate"\},&#xd;
\{"key":"customfield_10001,customfield_10124"\}]\}   &lt;= it should only have customfield_10124&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Create two custom fields with the same name, for instance "dupField" One may be a selection list, and the other a checkbox;&#xd;
2. The checkbox was added to the screens used by project "Test1", the Selection list for the project "Test2";&#xd;
3. Create some issues for the 'Test1" project, with values for the "dupField";&#xd;
4. In Confluence, create a new page and add the Jira Issues Macro;&#xd;
5. Use a JQL to select issues from the "Test1" project, and select the "dupField" column;&#xd;
6. Publish the page, observe that the column "dupField" is correct;&#xd;
7. In Jira, edit each "dupField" and change the context from Global to the specific project - So, dupFields checkbox with context to the project "Test1" and dupFields Selection list with context to the project "Test2";&#xd;
8. Refresh Confluence page&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No changes, the dupFields column is still visible.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * The column is no longer visible&#xd;
 * Using the view mode, when reaching the "Columns" icon, we can observe that the Custom Field is checked. Observe that when we opened this Columns window, the column "dupFields" was visible again. If we refresh the results, the column disappears again.&#xd;
 * Using the edit mode, when reaching the "Columns" icon, we can observe that the Custom Field is checked. Observe that when we opened this Columns window, the column "dupFields" was visible again. if we run the search, the column disappears.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Use Jira Legacy Macro. Select both dupFields and observe which column returned value;&#xd;
 * Remove the other dupFields that did not show values.</description><createDate>2025-01-03T20:29:56.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Although a workaround has been noted, having to modify many Confluence pages that are using the Jira Issues macro and replace them with the Jira Legacy macro isn't a very acceptable workaround.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Pages created with templates that have a index page, like the meeting notes template, does not keep page created under the folder hierarchy and places the page outside folder, under the index parent page automatically.&#xd;
This does not happen if a page from the template is created as a children of another parent page.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is extremely confusing as why it works with pages, but not with folders.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Access a space, and create a folder section&#xd;
 # Under that folder, create a new page with the '{*}Meeting notes'{*} template by using the '{_}Quick Actions{_}' section at the bottom to choose the template or using button "{*}...{*}" then "{_}*Templates &amp; import doc*{_}" to choose the template.&#xd;
 # Create a second page without using the template, outside the folder/index page hierarchy&#xd;
 # Create a children page under this parent page using the meeting notes template&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The page gets created successfully under that folder.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Page is placed automatically outside the folder and under the index page.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Place the index page inside the folder section to have it created automatically under the folder hierarchy, or drag and drop the created meeting notes page under the folder manually.</description><createDate>2024-11-11T11:30:21.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Tables inside Page Properties show unnecessary horizontal scroll bar</summary><key>CONFCLOUD-79961</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-79961</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When an automation is triggered to process multiple pages inside a branch and then add a *new* label, there might be a chance of creating multiple labels with the same name but different ids causing issues while you want to find those pages&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create an automation&#xd;
 # Add related entities branch&#xd;
 # Add a CQL example = "type=page"&#xd;
 # Inside the branch add action "Add label" create a new label&#xd;
 # Run the automation as test&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
At the database level we should have only one entry for each label name, however, multiple entries are found&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When a label has not been created and must be done inside the automation branch multiple labels with the same and different ids are name are created&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Migration is a long process, usually executed moving and validating few spaces per time. During the migration process, pages can be moved or renamed, causing the target links to fail with "Page not found error".&#xd;
&#xd;
However, when the link is using Confluence Storage Format, when hitting the link it tries to create a new page on the target space, instead of be smart to redirect to the new location or title name (ideally) or show a Page note found error, with the suggestion of the new location/new title.&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Confluence On-Prem with:&#xd;
Spaces A and the pages: "A page 1"&#xd;
Spaces B and the pages: "B page 2", "B page 3"&#xd;
Spaces C and the pages: "C page 2", "C page 3"&#xd;
&#xd;
2. Edit "A Page 1" on Space A to add links to the pages on space B and C;&#xd;
&#xd;
3. Hit the Link icon again, but select "search" and search for the pages "B page 2" and "C page 2". Observe that the link created will use the Confluence Storage Format:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;ac:link>&lt;ri:page ri:space-key="spaceB" ri:content-title="B page 2" />&lt;/ac:link>&#xd;
&lt;ac:link>&lt;ri:page ri:space-key="spaceC" ri:content-title="C page 2" />&lt;/ac:link>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
4. Copy and paste the URL from "B page 3" and "C page 3". Observe that the link created will also use the Confluence Storage Format:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;ac:link>&lt;ri:page ri:space-key="spaceB" ri:content-title="B page 3" />&lt;/ac:link>&#xd;
&lt;ac:link>&lt;ri:page ri:space-key="spaceC" ri:content-title="C page 3" />&lt;/ac:link>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
5. Migrate space A to Cloud using the Migration Assistance&#xd;
&#xd;
6. On Cloud, reach space A, "A page 1". Observe that:&#xd;
 * The target links remains on the same "A page 1" (!)&#xd;
&#xd;
7. Migrate space C to Cloud using the Migration Assistance&#xd;
&#xd;
9. On Cloud, reach space A, "A page 1". Observe that:&#xd;
 * Target links for the pages "C page 2" and "C page 3" now are working properly, opening the pages on space C.&#xd;
&#xd;
10. On the On-Prem environment, rename the pages on space B to "B renamed page 2", "B renamed page 3"&#xd;
&#xd;
11. Migrate space B to Cloud using the Migration Assistance&#xd;
&#xd;
12. On Cloud, reach space A, "A page 1".&#xd;
h3. Expected results&#xd;
&#xd;
It is expected to be redirected to "B renamed page 2" (ideally) or show "Page not found" error with the suggestion to the renamed page.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After converting pages from the legacy editor to the new editor in Confluence Cloud, the recently updated page owner is incorrectly reverting to the original page owner or creator.&#xd;
h4. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # User A create a new legacy page&#xd;
 # User A change owner of Page to User B&#xd;
 # User A edit and convert the page to fabric.&#xd;
 # Page Owner changed back to original creator User A.&#xd;
&#xd;
h4. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
After conversion, User B should retain ownership of the page.&#xd;
h4. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
After Conversion, system inaccurately assigns ownership back to original creator of legacy page, leading to discrepancies in user ownership.&#xd;
h4. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Target user can create a copy of the legacy editor page first and convert it instead. However, it's crucial to note that this workaround does not retain the page history, posing limitations on version tracking.</description><createDate>2024-08-26T03:06:44.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hello support, thanks for raising this bug report.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Confluence Automation fails to update page status when the scope is set to multiple spaces&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a custom status with the same name and color on two separate spaces&#xd;
 # Create an automation rule, with the following steps:&#xd;
 ** *Branch rule / related entities* - CQL=type = page&#xd;
 ** *Action - Change page status* - Select the custom status created on the first step&#xd;
 # On the rule's details, select scope as "Multiple spaces" and list the two spaces you created the custom status on&#xd;
 # Save the rule&#xd;
 # Run the rule&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The rule will sweep all pages on each of both spaces and add the custom status to all pages&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The rule will fail to change the page status from one of the spaces.&#xd;
When selecting the status on the action "Change page status", the list will be populated with all statuses from all spaces in scope, comparing their name and color, but not their ID. The custom status will be listed only once from one space.&#xd;
When the rule is run, it uses the custom status ID to update the pages. This will work for all pages in one space, but it won't find that status ID for the pages in the other space.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Error:* We can’t run a rule relating to page status on a global scope. Select Rule details and change the Scope field to one or more space.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Legacy pages with Jira Chart couldn't be loaded successfully, whenever Jira Chart hit into time out. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Integrate your Confluence Data Center with Jira Data Center. &#xd;
#- In Jira Data Center&#xd;
Add multiple custom values in your Jira fields&#xd;
#- In Confluence Data Center&#xd;
Add a page with Jira Chart macro pointing to the Jira Data Center above. Please make sure that we're retrieving the custom values from Jira Data Center accordingly. &#xd;
# Perform a Confluence migration using [CCMA app|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219672/confluence-cloud-migration-assistant?tab=overview].&#xd;
(i) Jira Data Center data is yet to be migrated at this point, which then led to Jira Charts having invalid JQLs.  &#xd;
# Attempt to view the page&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Page content loads successfully.&#xd;
&#xd;
(on) As this issue is originally occurred due to invalid JQLs, we should show the correct error message as follows (instead of 504), as well as rendering other page contents. &#xd;
 !Screenshot 2024-03-19 at 5.24.21 PM.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Page content fails to load (blank page) or the following generic error message ({{We couldn't find what you're looking for}}) is being shown instead.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
In the new editing experience, we're able to use Smart Links with a variety of links, such as google drive, dropbox, figma and box links.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, even though it works for app.box.com links to be rendered as smart links if the same are pasted from the share copy link, the same don't work if the link is not from the share link on box.com and if the link has the name of the company, such as companyname.box.com/s/filename instead of app.box.com/s/filename, the links doesn't render as smart links.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new page&#xd;
 # Paste a link from box.com from the share file link that has the similar link companyname.box.com/s/filename&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
After migrating Confluence pages that contain Jira macros the edit page does not show the columns for custom fields but those columns still render. Example below. No columns are shown in the edit view except "status" but the columns still render in the macro:&#xd;

 &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create Jira macro onprem inside Confluence page&#xd;
 # Migrate page to cloud&#xd;
 # Edit Jira macro and review Confluence columns&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All columns in use should show in the edit view&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Custom fields are not shown in the edit view. Running Jira macro repair or redindexing has no effect on this behavior. This is because the custom field id's have changed during migration.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Removing all custom fields from a macro and leaving only one built-in field, status for example, and then readding all the custom fields will show them correctly in the edit view going forward. This requires manual editing of all Jira macros however which is not scalable.</description><createDate>2023-10-03T22:52:07.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Confluence Cloud - Space Migration Fails with this error message - 'Container did not start'</summary><key>CONFCLOUD-76657</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-76657</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
There are spaces that have more than 1 million pages so the custom pdf export that is located at the Space level will never work for these spaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
Maybe, is better to add menu under Page Export to -> Word/PDF, to flip between current page versus current page + all child pages (no minitree as it will lead to the same problem with a page that has 1 million children pages).&#xd;
&#xd;
This way is faster for users too, they most likely just edited or looked at the page to be exported, rather than having to go out into the Space level menus and Export from there.&#xd;

The horizontal scroll bar is lost when converting a table or page properties macro report from a TinyMC editor to a prose-mirror editor. Additionally, the table is not wysiwyg between the editor and renderer.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a TinyMC page and add a table that overflows &#xd;
 # Copy the table&#xd;
 # Go to Create a new page on your instance, and select the ‘Legacy Editor’ template when creating.&#xd;
 # Paste the table or page properties report macro on the page, should see a horizontal scroll bar.&#xd;
 # Publish the page&#xd;
 # Edit the page again, you should be able to see a notification saying you can convert the page to use the new Editor.&#xd;
 # Follow the notification to convert the page&#xd;
 # The horizontal scroll is gone after convert&#xd;
 # Check the editor and renderer, you can see the scroll is not consistent between them.&#xd;
 # Please Check [^table scroll bar.mov]for more details.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The scroll bar should be maintained after the conversion&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The scroll bar is lost. Additionally, the table is not wysiwyg.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The Attachments macro can be configured to filter the list of attachments by labels. When this is configured, uploading attachments by clicking the "browse for files" macro will apply those labels to the uploaded attachments.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, the labels don't get added when using the drag-and-drop target in the macro.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Step: Create a page and add an attachments macro with the filter label.&#xd;
 # Step: Now drag and drop an attachment.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The label is expected to be added to the attachment.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The label is not added to the attachment using drag-and-drop but when we try to "browse for files" and upload, it adds the label.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
If files are uploaded using drag-and-drop, then go to the page > More > Attachments, click and add the label for the desired attachment.</description><createDate>2023-04-03T07:48:15.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>{panel:title=Atlassian Update - March 31, 2025|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}

Let's say the page relies heavily on images and since its creation, 64 versions have been created. Each version has an average of 20 image changes. At version 65 you'll end up with a huge amount of attachments that might not need to be parsed or even copied over to the new page.</text><author>Guillaume Cheseaux</author></comments><comments><text>@Damian thanks for finding this!</text><author>Adrian Kupis</author></comments><comments><text>Hi team, please reconsider the priority of this issue. Before, on Server, we used to have most of our attachments under the space's Attachments directory. This directory has been moved to our space's root page in Cloud. So now we ended up with one page having over 4000 attachments in each version.&#xd;
&#xd;
In our company we use Scroll Documents to manage the versions of our documentation on the Cloud. Because of this bug, the said page cannot be copied and hence, we cannot create a new version of our documentation. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is a huge blocker. Because of this we cannot publish our documentation to our customers as we cannot have new versions.  And because of this we are still using Confluence Server whereas we were planning on going live with the Cloud version in July. &#xd;
&#xd;
As the Server support is approaching its end of life and we cannot switch to Cloud because of this bug, we seem to be stuck and that is why the resolution of this bug is essential to us.</text><author>Dima Ilieva</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue cost me several week of delay in getting my Confluence [Product]Manual to produce a Scroll Document Version to publish to our online Help Centers (several weeks after the Prod version of the Product was released) .&#xd;
&#xd;
At first I opened a Support ticket with Confluence and the support guy closed the ticket insisting this was not a Confluence issue but rather a "3rd Party product issue" (i.e., Scroll Doc /K15t Support issue). I was not impressed :( as up to this point I have enjoyed excellent support from Atlassian. &#xd;
&#xd;
Scroll / K15t Support were much more diligent in helping me and directed me to look at the 1st Page (I call it the manual title page) “Attachments”. There were 299 “Attachments” (but there were actually no images on this title page). Then he directed me to install another 3rd party product called “Attachment Manager”. &#xd;
&#xd;
Once I quickly got rid of the 299 “unused” attachments on my Manual Title Page with Attachment Manager I was able to successfully create a new Scroll Doc version.&#xd;
&#xd;
I’m not thrilled that we have to buy this “Attachments Manager” to fix what seems to be a Confluence bug or at least attachment management shortcoming - that's why I'm casting my vote on this  CONFCLOUD-75318- Copy REST API returns 504 for pages with many attachments) issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Please bump up the priority of this issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Also, please advise the Confluence Support Team about this issue &amp; this workaround “Attachment Manager” so others won't be impeded by this issue. [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1222381/attachments-manager-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview]&#xd;

The endpoint also returns 504 on pages with 200 attachments and there isn't a homogenous error response. We get an *Internal server error* as a message and sometimes an HTML format as a message with the title *{{Something went wrong}}* and body *We're moving mountains to get it sorted.*&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The workaround does not help in our case (Comala Publishing Cloud), since we need some functionality of the affected endpoint, like the destination params. With the workaround endpoint you can not copy a page in a specific space as a root page, only accept copying the page in an existing page ID ({*}destinationPageId{*}) and you can not replace the content page on an existing page, if the page already exists the endpoint returns a 400 status with message {*}com.atlassian.confluence.api.service.exceptions.BadRequestException: The copied content tree has conflicting titles. Please specify a title prefix to avoid conflict.{*}{*}{{*}}&#xd;
&#xd;
Since more of our clients are migrating from server to cloud, we are having more support tickets related to this problem. The problem dates back to last year and has still not been solved. Please, reconsider the priority of this issue or give us a workaround that could fit our case when you need the same functionality of the affected endpoint.&#xd;

Thanks.</text><author>Miguel Angel Zapatero</author></comments><comments><text>The workaround will not work for us as it's completely functionally different - you cannot update existing pages using the hierarchy copy, which is a core feature of our use case, and you additionally do not receive information about the created page, another core requirement of our use case.

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue only happens when moving multiple pages at the same time and is consistently reproducible.&#xd;
&#xd;
When moving a page tree between two spaces, if one of the pages contains {*}attachments with links pointing to pages within the same page tree{*}, the attachments will break. &#xd;

&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
 * Confluence Cloud&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
1. Create page page tree. Here's an example:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
Parent page&#xd;
├─ Child page 1&#xd;
├─ Child page 2  &#xd;
└─ Child page 3{code}&#xd;
2. Add attachments to the parent page.&#xd;
&#xd;
3. Copy the link from the child pages.&#xd;
&#xd;
4. Add the links from the child pages to each of the attachments.&#xd;
&#xd;
5. Move the page tree to a different space.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The attachments shouldn't break&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The attachments containing links to pages that were moved together will break. They display as "Unknown Attachments".&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2022-08-25-14-10-26-352.png|width=226,height=218!&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There are two ways to prevent this issue from happening:&#xd;
 # Users can move the pages individually. That is, first move the page containing the attachments with links, then the other pages.&#xd;
 # Make a copy of the pages instead of moving them. Depending on the scenario, that's not a good choice as the author of the page will change and the page history will be lost.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Note&#xd;

Best regards, Corentin[Requirement Yogi]</text><author>Corentin</author></comments><comments><text>This longstanding issue is a critical blocker for our use of Confluence as a documentation system.  &#xd;
&#xd;
We need to be able to create offline packages of our rich sites (using various add-on macros, including specifically Requirements Yogi) with the HTML export function for customer audit requirements and our information retention policies.&#xd;
&#xd;
The only workaround at this time would be to license the Scroll HTML Exporter, which does make the necessary [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/macro-render-modes/] API calls to reconstruct full HTML representations of the Confluence pages.&#xd;
&#xd;
This seems like such an easy fix.  It already is working correctly for the PDF and Word exports, the absence in the HTML export is pretty egregious at this point.&#xd;
&#xd;
Perhaps Atlassian can gift us a free license to Scroll HTML exporter while they figure it out?</text><author>Drew Cox</author></comments><comments><text>For reference, see also this forum post from 2022.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When spaces or global templates are using the legacy editor, there will have an option to convert it so they can use the current/new editor of Confluence.&#xd;
&#xd;
Depending on how the edit mode for them is structured, a different result will happen, but, the template will not get converted.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make sure to have templates that were created with the legacy editor.&#xd;
 # On a space that has the template, the *Convert* option {*}may or may not be displayed{*}.&#xd;
 # Tap the *Convert* button is visible and confirm the conversion after the preview.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
After the preview and confirmation, the template should be converted to the new/current editor.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * *Convert button Not available*&#xd;
 * If tapping the *Edit* button of the template redirects to the legacy editor mode ([https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/templates2/editpagetemplate.action?entityId=ID_HERE&amp;key=SPACE_KEY]), upon tapping the *Convert* button, a message stating that the conversion has worked will be displayed, but the template will still use the legacy editor:&#xd;
!success_template.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
 * If the edit mode automatically has the template in the new/current editor ([https://example.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SPACE_KEY/templates/edit/TEMPLATE-ID]), upon tapping the *Convert* button, a message stating that the template could not be found will be displayed:&#xd;
!not_found.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * When convert button is not available manually re-create the template using the current/new editor&#xd;
 * For the scenarios where the "edit" button redirects to the new/current editor, use the "Edit" button and publish the template, which will convert it to the new editor.&#xd;
 * For the scenarios where the "edit" button will redirect to the legacy one, manually re-create the template using the current/new editor</description><createDate>2021-06-22T20:08:05.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We have this same issue that started in our Confluence Cloud environment since this week.

*In Jira*&#xd;
 # Create a next-gen project in Jira.&#xd;
# Create a custom field to an issue type.&#xd;
# Create new issues using this issue type.&#xd;
# Populate the custom field.&#xd;

When updating a draft using the REST API (PUT /wiki/rest/api/content/\{id\}?status=draft), the draft's body.storage will be updated but those changes won't take effect on the editor.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
With the new inline comments feature, working on Confluence got easier with the possibility to add these comments from within the editor. &#xd;
 Though that's a great feature, it seems it is not working well when an inline comment is being added within a third-party macro.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Install one of the below third-party add-ons on Confluence (for example):&#xd;
 ** [Numbered Headings|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/16063/numbered-headings?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview];&#xd;
 ** [Table Filter and Charts for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/27447/table-filter-and-charts-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview];&#xd;
** [Content Formatting Macros for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/247/content-formatting-macros-for-confluence?hosting=cloud]&#xd;
 # Create a new page;&#xd;
 # Insert a macro from one of the installed add-ons;&#xd;
 # After typing some text within the macros, add an inline comment somewhere in this text;&#xd;
 # Publish the page.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The inline comment is being shown in the text.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
No inline comment can be seen.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Notes*:&#xd;
 * It might be happening with other different third-party macros - the 2 mentioned above are just as an example, since they were macros we tested this behavior;&#xd;
 * From the published page, if we add {{?focusedCommentId=COMMENT_ID#comment-COMMENT_ID}} at the end of the URL, the comment gets shown at the right side of the screen.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior, but removing the content from within the macros will get the inline comment shown in the text.</description><createDate>2020-12-02T13:24:33.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>As we use inline commenting more and more, we noticed that it works with (3rd party, for example the scroll exporter extensions for cloud.) macros in the editing mode of a page, but not after the page is published. &#xd;
&#xd;
This is very confusing for our users. In editing mode, it is only useful for some situations. You can't see the comments if you look at the published page or add comments to a published page.&#xd;
&#xd;
As we use inline commenting more and more, this significantly impacts the usefulness of Confluence for our users.</text><author>Jor</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Space PDF Export timer is not acurate</summary><key>CONFCLOUD-70799</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-70799</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Hi everyone,

Thank you for previously raising this bug and bringing it to our attention.

Within our company roadmap and work capacity, we try to address or review each bug request but admit that not each one will be resolved. To continue the culture of being honest and open, we are closing this bug to focus on our upcoming roadmap for all Confluence users.

As we continue to roll out features we do look at requests made by our users and if you feel like this bug is still impacting your team please let us know.

Thank you again for providing valuable feedback to our team!

I've never seen anything like that before. An open statement that actually means that 'available software option does not work whatsoever, and we don't care, that's your problem.'&#xd;

By the way - the priority is wrong. Based on Medium Severity definition:&#xd;
'The application or specific feature isn't working as expected, {*}but there is a workaround available{*}.'&#xd;

There is no workaround available so that bug meets criteria of High Severity:&#xd;

When I insert a JIRA Issue/Filter macro on a Confluence page as a table, a long text is not wrapped and the width of the column is fixed by the length of the text. &#xd;
 If the the page is then exported to Word or PDF, the table either runs off the page (Word) or columns are missing entirely (PDF).&#xd;

Update: The Change History macro is causing this issue. After removing the Change History macro from the Confluence page, the text is wrapping as expected and all the table columns I have defined are visible on the page even after exporting to Word and PDF formats.&#xd;

Note: Depending on the number of columns defined,JIRA Issue/Filter Macro tables are prone to overflow the page when exported.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When downgrading a product license from Enterprise to Premium, any existing sandboxes will be deactivated.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # While on an Enterprise plan, create a sandbox.&#xd;
 # At any point the subscription is downgraded to Premium. This can also happen if the sandbox was created while on an Enterprise trial.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Despite the downgrade, the sandbox should still be functional as both Enterprise and Premium subscriptions are entitled to sandboxes.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The sandbox will be deactivated and you will be unable to restore it from the admin page, getting the error below:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If the organization has multiple site, project admins can see the users [Project settings] > [People] > [Add people] > "Names or emails" list.&#xd;
They can see the users who are not added to the site but added to the same organization.&#xd;
&#xd;
Select the user from "Names or emails" list and [Add] does not trigger the user invitation.&#xd;
So the added user is listed in [Project settings] > [People], but they are not added to the site and granted the product access. They can't access to the project until the product access is granted.&#xd;
&#xd;
Even the [User access settings > User invites|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/control-how-users-get-access-to-products/#User-invites] is configured as invite anyone, invite is not triggered.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the single org, there are 2 sites (Site A &amp; B). User X is project admin for site A, and User Y is product user of site B&#xd;
 # User X add the User Y to the project via [Project settings] > [People] > [Add people] > Selecting "Names or emails" list&#xd;
 # User Y is not received the invitation, and checking the User Y product access in admin.atlassian.com, product access for Site A is not granted.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Adding the user who belongs to same org should trigger the user invitation based on user access settings.&#xd;

h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Adding the user who belongs to same org does not trigger user invitation.&#xd;

&#xd;
When migrating Confluence spaces from cloud to cloud the 'Create from template' macro doesn't work and displays the following message when clicked on:&#xd;
{quote}The original template has been deleted. Select a new template for the Create From Template macro.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
This is reproducible on a cloud site: Yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a space on the source site;&#xd;
 # Create a new page and add the 'Create from Template' macro button, point it to the page desired template;&#xd;
 # Migrate space from Cloud to Cloud via 'Copy Product Data';&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The 'create-from-template' macro button works on the destination. But it doesn't.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking the macro button causes the following message to show:&#xd;
{quote}The original template has been deleted. Select a new template for the Create From Template macro.&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
h4. Some Notes&#xd;
 - Below is the 'View Storage Format' from the source site:&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;p>&#xd;
   &lt;ac:structured-macro ac:name="create-from-template" ac:schema-version="1" ac:local-id="db40b7c6-97f5-4d5a-a7c6-f6acb5c0892a" ac:macro-id="733ada09-fdeb-4a66-8c55-ef9b01d7a26f">&#xd;

   ...&#xd;
   &lt;/ac:structured-macro>&#xd;
&lt;p/>&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
- The 'View Storage Format' from the destination site is the same as the source page.&#xd;
&#xd;
(!) After performing the workaround on the destination, the parameter IDs are now updated to the expected ones. &#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
&lt;p>&#xd;

&lt;p/>&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Edit the macro on the page and hit 'Save' on the 'Create from Template' macro without changing the parameters. If you don't hit the 'Save' button and update the page, hit the 'Cancel', the behavior persists.</description><createDate>2024-11-06T18:24:42.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Site URL is unavailable even though no active site is associated with it</summary><key>CLOUD-12043</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-12043</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
In a scenario where a customer is trying to create an Atlassian Cloud site with a desired name but for some technical reasons if the creation fails, then the site name will show as “Taken” or “Already in use” even though the URL is not associated with any active site.&#xd;
&#xd;
The URL gets placed in a short-term reservation list on our end and, hence, can't be associated with any site. This short-term reservation is for a period of 7 days, after which the URL will be released for use.&#xd;
h3. Suggestion:&#xd;
&#xd;
It would be great to reduce the wait time or allow customers to release the URL manually after the failure in creation.&#xd;
Also, it would be helpful to display a relevant message in the UI stating the reason for URL unavailability and the expected release time.</description><createDate>2024-09-23T06:19:17.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Signup Platform team has created a ticket in the backlog - https://hello.jira.atlassian.cloud/browse/BXPSU-3844</text><author>Joe Ferng</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>Data security policies cannot be deactivated or deleted because of deleted sandbox instances.</summary><key>CLOUD-12012</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-12012</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
When a specific Jira product is unsubscribed on the production site, the corresponding sandbox site for the product is also deleted. However, it is possible that this action might cause the entire Jira sandbox site to be inaccessible. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Ensure you have Jira (JSW) and Jira Service Management (JSM) premium subscription on a cloud site&#xd;
 # Create JSW and JSM sandbox sites in the Organization&#xd;
 # De-activate JSM premium product subscription on the production site&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Since the JSM product is deactivated, the JSM sandbox site will be deleted. However, the JSW sandbox site should still be active since the JSW product subscription is active.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
When the JSM product is deactivated, the entire sandbox cloud site (JSW and JSM) are inaccessible. The following message is seen in the UI:&#xd;
{quote}The Sandbox site has been deleted{quote}&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
Users from within China experience slower performance with Atlassian products.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Cause&#xd;
 This is due to [Great Firewall of China|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall] blocking or restricting internet contents from outside China. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Note&#xd;
&#xd;
Atlassian discloses domains and IP addresses that need to be allowed: [IP addresses and domains for Atlassian cloud products|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/ip-addresses-and-domains-for-atlassian-cloud-products/].&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Workaround&#xd;
Using a VPN provider (preferably outside China) Could help boost performance. No guarantees on how much is expected.</description><createDate>2018-10-11T02:08:03.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>The priority of this issue is currently Low, but we have four important partner development teams that we work with throughout China (Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou).  If the usage experience cannot be improved, we will have to seek an alternative platform, as the current latency makes Jira EXTREMELY slow, and even unusable for some.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The VPN workaround is no longer an effective solution for most in China, as restrictions on VPN usage in China have been heightened significantly.&#xd;
&#xd;
Is there a possibility that Atlassian will deploy something within mainland China? </text><author>Gaston@TS</author></comments><comments><text>Same situation here - Jira/Confluence access from Shanghai site is intermittent. We are using VPN, but VPN service itself can be blocked from time to time.&#xd;

Truly need a reliable solution from Atlassian. We don't have the issue with Github...&#xd;
&#xd;
 </text><author>Dinghua</author></comments><comments><text>Given AWS is available in China (whilst managed through a third party), surely this could be looked into.

&#xd;
POST requests are vulnerable to CSRF attacks and as security best practice the common security layer enforces CSRF validation if no content type is specified.&#xd;
&#xd;
When content-type of `application/json` is specified, and the fact that the request is not coming from a browser, this CSRF validation is bypassed and the REST endpoint is allowed to process the request.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Bitbucket version 9.4.4 comes with PostgreSQL JDBC driver postgresql-42.7.5.jar; Bitbucket 9.4.3 uses postgresql-42.7.4.jar. The PostgreSQL driver 42.7.5 has issues when checking for the existence of database tables if the database name is {*}uppercase{*}.&#xd;
&#xd;
After upgrading Bitbucket 9.4.3 to 9.4.4 using an existing uppercase-named PostgreSQL database, liquibase tries to create its own "databasechangelog" table although that one already exists, and fails.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a database with an upper-case name:&#xd;
{code:sql}&#xd;
create user bb_user with password 'bb_user';&#xd;
create database "DB_UPPERCASE" with owner bb_user encoding 'UTF8';&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 # Install Bitbucket 9.4.3 and point it to that database --> everything works fine.&#xd;
 # Shut down Bitbucket 9.4.3, "upgrade" it to 9.4.4, and point to the same database --> error is logged:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Bamboo warnings can no longer be seen in Bitbucket pull request page.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create Application links between Bitbucket and Bamboo DC and make sure they are in connected state.&#xd;
# Add linked repository (testrepo) in Bamboo&#xd;
 # In Bitbucket, create/push a file in java/any other language (ex. test.java) that writes warnings on compilation into "testrepo"&#xd;
# In Bamboo, create a plan and add the following tasks &#xd;
## configure a script task to compile the source file in Bitbucket. For example - {code}javac -Xlint test.java{code} that compiles the test.java file in Bitbucket and reports errors&#xd;
## Configure "Build warnings parser" configuration task to compile the source code file&#xd;
# Navigate to "Branches" tab in Bamboo plan configuration and select "When a pull request is created (Forked repositories are allowed)" under "Create plan branch" section. &#xd;
# Save the Bamboo plan configuration and enable the plan. &#xd;
# Create a branch b1 and make/push changes to the file {{test.java}}&#xd;
# Create a pull request from b1 -> master which triggers a build in Bamboo.&#xd;
# Bamboo warnings hyperlink is not seen in Pull request overview page &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Bamboo warnings are seen directly in Pull request page.&#xd;

If I cannot see newly introduced warnings in the pull request diff, this will definitely cause issues in the future. It's undoubtedly making reviews less effective.

Issue Summary&#xd;
Elasticsearch support was deprecated in 8.x and removed in 9.x.  The documentation found at https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver094/install-and-configure-a-remote-elasticsearch-server-1489802994.html doesn't give any indication that Elasticsearch must not be used for any 9.x version&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
A bold warning that this document is no longer valid once you upgrade to 9.0 or higher&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
This document discusses how Elasticsearch, up to 7.17.16, can still be configured and used by Bitbucket.  No indication using Elasticsearch will generate errors in the logs, and it is unlikely to function&#xd;

&#xd;
Using the below API to manually post the build status:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
http://{baseurl}/rest/api/latest/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/commits/{commitId}/builds'{code}&#xd;
without the {{PARENT}} parameter gives the warning on the Bitbucket UI "{_}Successful build of testFolder for the latest commit is required before this pull request can be merged{_}".&#xd;
We need to update the REST API documentation to make this a required parameter.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the request body of the API&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
http://{baseurl}/rest/api/latest/projects/{projectKey}/repos/{repositorySlug}/commits/{commitId}/builds'&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
don't include the parent parameter:&#xd;

 # Manually try to run this API query to POST the build status.&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The API should be able to add/update the Build status to Bitbucket&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The warning "{_}Successful build of testFolder for the latest commit is required before this pull request can be merged{_}" can be seen on the Bitbucket UI.&#xd;
For the _Required builds_ feature to work, we look for the *Parent* parameter and check if it has successful builds attached to it&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The *parent* parameter is the one we check to determine if the build is successful or not, here's an example:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;

    "key": "TEST-REP123",&#xd;
    "state": "SUCCESSFUL",&#xd;
    "url": "https://bamboo.url/browse/TEST-REP1-3",&#xd;

        "skipped": 8,&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Viewing pull requests that contain large, binary files in a [forking workflow|https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow] can leave behind {{tmp_pack_*}} files.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue occurs when the backend {{git fetch}} command for retrieving the PR's effective diff takes longer than a pre-configured limit of 60 seconds.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Use [forking workflow|https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow]&#xd;
 # Create a PR from the fork repo to the target repo&#xd;
 # Add several commits that include non-LFS tracked large, binary files to the source repo&#xd;
{_}Note{_}: there should be enough differences between the source and target branches to make the backend {{git fetch}} command called by the {{getEffectiveDiff}} method take more than 60 seconds and cause a timeout.&#xd;
 # View the pull request's Diff tab&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The PR Diff tab can be viewed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Viewing the Diff tab returns a "Server Unreachable" error in the web UI.&#xd;
&#xd;
This action can leave behind large {{tmp_pack_*}} files in the {{&lt;$BITBUCKET_HOME>/shared/data/repositories/&lt;REPO_ID>/objects/pack}} directory.&#xd;
&#xd;
In severe cases, the {{tmp_pack_*}} files can lead to all disk space being consumed and cause an outage.&#xd;

Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
It is not possible to use Bitbucket 8.19 (Hazelcast 5.2) in Azure setups that *use Virtual Machine Scale Sets*, with Azure IMDS discovery, that is with &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.instance.metadata.available=true&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
A bug in Azure's API does not allow the tagging of network interfaces in a VMSS (on the contrary, tagging of network interfaces in a standalone VMs work).&#xd;
&#xd;
The equivalent setup with Bitucket 7.x (Hazelcast 3.12) in our test environment worked.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Analysis&#xd;
&#xd;
Hazelcast 5.2 relies on Azure REST API endpoint [List Virtual Machine Scale Set Network Interfaces|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/network-interface-in-vm-ss/list-virtual-machine-scale-set-network-interfaces?view=rest-virtualnetwork-2023-09-01&amp;tabs=HTTP] to get tagged interfaces. Due to the Azure problem, no interfaces are tagged and Hazelcast doesn't form a cluster.&#xd;
&#xd;
# Bitbucket 7.x uses Hazelcast 3.12. &#xd;
Hazelcast 3.12 uses Microsoft-provided libraries for access to Azure API.&#xd;
# Bitbucket 8.19 uses Hazelcast 5.2, which no longer uses Microsoft libraries. &#xd;
Instead, it relies on publicly documented Azure REST API.&#xd;
# When running as part of a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS), the [code inside Hazelcast 5.2|https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/azure/AzureComputeApi.java#L91-L93] does this:&#xd;
## Calls Azure REST API endpoint [List Virtual Machine Scale Set Network Interfaces|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/network-interface-in-vm-ss/list-virtual-machine-scale-set-network-interfaces?view=rest-virtualnetwork-2023-09-01&amp;tabs=HTTP].&#xd;
## Parses the response [looking for the "tag" property|https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/azure/AzureComputeApi.java#L102] attached to the network interface.&#xd;
&#xd;
Here is the problem: *network interfaces attached to VM instances operating inside the Azure VM scale set are not tagged by Azure*.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. What we tried&#xd;
&#xd;
We tried to tag network interfaces using several approaches but to no avail:&#xd;
# Add tags to the network interface while creating a VM scale set.&#xd;
Azure accepts the tag, but no tags are assigned to any interface when looking through the above REST API endpoint.&#xd;
# When we try from the https://portal.azure.com web portal, going to "VM scale set / Networking / Network settings / Network security group" then "Network interfaces / &lt;choose one interface>", then choose "Add tags", there is an error displayed in the web UI:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Details&#xd;
columnNumber: 57 fileName: https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/hDWs869FxoLX.js line 37 > Function lineNumber: 3 message: Unable to process binding "with: function(){return tagsEditor }" Message: tagsEditor is not defined name: ReferenceError stack: with@https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/hDWs869FxoLX.js line 37 > Function:3:57 i@https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/hDWs869FxoLX.js:37:7336 f/t&lt;/&lt;@https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/hDWs869FxoLX.js:37:10772 o/init/&lt;@https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/hDWs869FxoLX.js:37:22638 evaluateImmediate_CallReadThenEndDependencyDetection@https://portal.azure.com/Content/Dynamic/H7ZYsMnJ-ch2.js:43:29183&#xd;
...&#xd;
...&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# [REST API "add tag to network interface"|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/network-interfaces/update-tags?view=rest-virtualnetwork-2023-09-01&amp;tabs=HTTP] also does not work and displays an error:&#xd;

  }&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The same thing happens with both "system assigned managed identity" and "user assigned managed identity".&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. How to replicate&#xd;
&#xd;
# Setup an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set with 2 VM instances to use metadata discovery (IMDS)&#xd;
** Try to add tags to network interfaces using any approach - it won't work. The setup will still be without tags on the interfaces.&#xd;
# Try to form a Hazelcast 5.2 cluster (use Bitbucket 8.19 or some test code)&#xd;
** Cluster forming will fail, there will be 2 clusters each with 1 node.&#xd;
&#xd;
h2. Known workarounds&#xd;
&#xd;
# Use the Bitbucket clustering configuration with an Azure service principal settings, that is setting all of these properties:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.instance.metadata.available=false&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.tag=...&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.resource.group=...&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.tenant.id=...&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.subscription.id=...&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.client.id=...&#xd;
hazelcast.network.azure.client.secret=...&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
# Use the {{tcpip}} discovery mechanism and add the IP addresses as a hardcoded list in the {{bitbucket.properties}} file. This may be automated as new nodes being added can just add the complete list of nodes to their list. When that new node connects to existing nodes, that list will update all other nodes as well.&#xd;
{panel:title=Note}&#xd;
[Hazelcast - Discovering Members by TCP |https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.2/clusters/discovering-by-tcp] mentions "You do not have to list all these cluster members, but at least one of the listed members has to be active in the cluster when a new member joins"&#xd;

[Issue #26494|https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/26494] has been raised and a [patch submitted |https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/26495](pending review/acceptance).&#xd;
&#xd;
As a workaround, customers can use TCP/IP discovery mechanism, which only require specifying the IP address of a known _master_ node. Other nodes / new nodes added through autoscaling can use this IP address as an "entry point" into the cluster.&#xd;
&#xd;
Details of the bug and patch follows.&#xd;
&#xd;
Hazelcast's Azure Discover Strategy works as follows:&#xd;
 # Retrieve list of network interfaces using the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST api ([https://management.azure.com|https://management.azure.com/])&#xd;
 # Filter the network interfaces for the presence of a specific tag (e.g. HZ-CLUSTER=MY-CLUSTER)&#xd;
 # The IP addresses of the filtered network interfaces are used as candidates of the cluster and join attempts will proceed against them&#xd;
&#xd;
However, Hazelcast uses the {{Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/networkInterfaces}} resource to retrieve network interfaces when running under VMSS, which seems to always return an empty array [], causing it to form a single node cluster containing the itself as the only member.&#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, it seems that [tagging network interfaces at the VMSS level|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-support#microsoftcompute] is not supported - tagging must be performed on individual network interfaces (on each VM in the VMSS).&#xd;
&#xd;
The patch to fix the issue simply uses the {{Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces}} resource to retrieve network interfaces when running in a VMSS. This resource returns all networks interfaces available for the subscription / resource group, with each network interface containing tags that Hazelcast can use to filter on</text><author>David Zhu</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>The Default Reviewer Conditions User Interface Has a Hard Limit of 100 Entries instead of pagination</summary><key>BSERV-18990</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-18990</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The Default Reviewer Conditions User Interface currently has a hard limit of 100 entries, lacking pagination. This limitation can lead to confusion in repositories with numerous rules, as not all reviewer conditions will be displayed in the interface, causing uncertainty about the application of specific rules.&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
Create a 100+ default reviewer conditions for a repository.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
All the reviewer conditions should be displayed using paging system.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Not all the reviewer conditions are displayed.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
On moving a Jira issue key from one project to another project in Jira, Bitbucket associates the pull request and branch information to 2 Jira issue keys (Old issue key and new issue key). This causes duplicate pull requests and branch information to appear in Jira development panel.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: yes&#xd;
Issue is reproducible on Jira Cloud as well.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Create a repository (repo1) in Bitbucket&#xd;
# Create 2 projects in Jira (HOT, COOL)&#xd;
# Create an issue in HOT, i.e HOT-1&#xd;
# Create a new branch in Bitbucket (branch1)&#xd;
# Push a change to branch1&#xd;
# specifying issue key HOT-1 in the commit message and Create a pull request specifying issue key HOT-1 in the pull request title&#xd;
# You will see the commit and pull request details appearing in Jira development panel for issue HOT-1&#xd;
# Move the issue key HOT-1 from one project to another project in Jira, in this case, HOT to COOL project&#xd;
# The issue key HOT-1 is changed to COOL-1 in project COOL&#xd;
# Push another commit to the branch branch1 specifying the latest issue key which is COOL-1 and create a pull request specifying issue key COOL-1 in the pull request title&#xd;
# You will now see 2 pull requests (#1 duplicate records) and 2 branches in Jira development panel.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Only one pull request per PR ID/branch per branch is expected to appear in Jira development panel &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Two pull request records per PR ID/ 2 branch records per branch appear in Jira development panel.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Overriding the default cache-control header (Cache-Control: no-transform, max-age=600, stale-if-error=86400, stale-while-revalidate=86400 ) and if max-age, stale-if-error, stale-while-revalidate are not set for Jira, then it causes the smart commits to stop working.&#xd;
&#xd;
This issue is noticed in environment where Jira is running behind IIS where ASP.NET is registered with IIS and the application pool doesn't have the "No Managed code" selected. But this is not limited to IIS , if the proxy overrides the cache-control as mentioned above, this issue may occur.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Note:* This will affect *all remote events that Bitbucket publishes* if the consumer that subscribes to those events is behind a proxy that is overriding the {{Cache-Control}} header in the response. It is not specific to just Jira and Smart commits but all Bitbucket events Jira is interested in and even Bamboo events such as branch created, branch changed, pull request events etc.&#xd;
 &#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
&#xd;
Bitbucket Server has an application link with a Jira instance which is running behind proxy and proxy is overriding Cache-control header.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Example with IIS&#xd;
 * Configure IIS in front of Jira&#xd;
 * Register ASP.NET for IIS with a command as below&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
cd C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319&#xd;
 C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319>dism /online /enable-feature /all /featurename:IIS-ASPNET45 &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Find the Application pool that site is using and change the .NET CLR Version to .NET CLR Version 4.x.x.x&#xd;
 * Create application Link with Bitbucket&#xd;
 * Restart Bitbucket to make sure cache is cleared&#xd;
 * Test smart commit&#xd;
 * To check the cache-control run curl with verbose and verify the header&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
curl -v http://&lt;JIRA-URL>/rest/remote-event-consumer/1/capabilities&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
For projects, when using the API, or when viewing inspecting the object in the UI, the avatar resource link is returned in the following JSON object:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
    },&#xd;
    "html": {&#xd;
      "href": "https://bitbucket.org/&lt;workspaceID>/workspace/projects/&lt;projectKey>/avatar"&#xd;
    },&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
However, this is not the case with repositories' and workspaces' avatars. These resources are available in  the following format instead for repositories and workspaces:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
    "avatar": {&#xd;
      "href": "https://bytebucket.org/ravatar/%7B&lt;UUID>%7D"&#xd;
    },&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
The impact of this is that, for repositories and workspaces, the avatar image can be viewed publicly, without requiring users to be logged into Bitbucket. This is inconsistent with the behavior of projects, which require the user to be authenticated before redirecting to the appropriate resource in S3.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
There are two ways to reproduce this:&#xd;
First option:&#xd;
 # Navigate to any project in the UI;&#xd;
 # Open the devtools console (F12) and click on the avatar for the project&#xd;
 # You should see that the reference for the avatar resource is https://bitbucket.org/&lt;workspaceID>/workspace/projects/&lt;projectKey>&#xd;
&#xd;
Second option:&#xd;
 # Use the following Bitbucket API endpoint &#xd;
{code}&#xd;
https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project_key}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 # Check the response. The project avatar object will look like this:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
    },&#xd;
    "html": {&#xd;
      "href": "https://bitbucket.org/&lt;workspaceID>/workspace/projects/&lt;projectKey>/avatar"&#xd;
    },&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The Avatar reference to the resource should reference the appropriate bytebucket link in the API and UI, like so:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
https://bytebucket.org/ravatar/%7B&lt;UUID>%7D&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
This will allow users to access the avatar resource without authentication, to be consistent with other endpoints such as repositories and workspaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Bitbucket references the following link to redirect to the Avatar resource for projects, both on API and UI:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
https://bitbucket.org/&lt;workspaceID>/workspace/projects/&lt;projectKey>/avatar&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
When importing a Bitbucket repository, valid URL formats are being rejected. For example, the following URL formats are considered valid:&#xd;
 * {{https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo/src/master/}}&#xd;
 * {{https://bitbucket.org/workspace/repo}}&#xd;
 * {{https://username@bitbucket.org/workspace/repo.git}}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Click on *Create Repository* → {*}Import{*}.&#xd;
 # Enter any of the above repository URL formats.&#xd;
 # The system displays a "No repository exists at that URL." error (404 not found).&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The import should validate the URL as correct and proceed with the repository import.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The system throws a 404 error with the message: "No repository exists at that URL."&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Users can continue to use one of the valid URL formats by explicitly entering the username, password, project, and repo name, then clicking on import. In such cases, the repository imports successfully. If any error occurs during this process, it should be reported to bitbucket cloud support.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Next link for Pagination in Bitbucket API uses workspace and repo slugs instead of IDs which breaks forge apps.&#xd;
&#xd;
This affects many APIs including [List Commits|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-commits/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-commits-get] and [List pipeline variables|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pipelines/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-pipelines-config-variables-get] etc will have a next page link like this.&#xd;
&#xd;
For example, [List pipeline variables|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pipelines/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-pipelines-config-variables-get] will have next link in the following format.&#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
"next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/${workspace_slug}/${repo_slug}/pipelines_config/variables?page=2&amp;pagelen=10",&#xd;

&#xd;
If we try to use this with [Forge routeFromAbsolute|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/apis-reference/fetch-api-product.requestbitbucket/#absolute-path-construction--routefromabsolute-] then we get a 400 - INVALID_TARGET_URL error.&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a Forge app for Bitbucket&#xd;
 # Using *requestBitbucket* call the next page using the link received in the first response&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The next page can be retrieved using the next link&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
we get a 400 - INVALID_TARGET_URL error. Because, *requestBitbucket* expects workspace and repo IDs in the link and not slugs.&#xd;

If a user approves a pull request and then starts a batch comment review while another user merges the pull request, the first user can remove their own approval at the end of the review, leading to a merged pull request that has missing approvals.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # User 1 approves User 2's pull request&#xd;
 # User 1 starts adding comments to User 2's pull request with a batch comment review.&#xd;
 # User 2 merges the pull request, since the minimum approval branch restriction is met.&#xd;
 # Without refreshing the page, user 1 finishes the review and selects "No status" for submitting the review.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The pull request should still be allowed to be merged. However, user 1 should not have the ability to clear their approval for a pull request that has been merged. Potentially, users who are in the middle of a batch comment review should have their review discarded when the pull request becomes merged.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The pull request is in a "merged" state, but user 1's approval is missing from the pull request and the approval event is no longer shown in the activity feed. However, the minimum approvals branch restriction is still passing.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
When batch comment reviews are in progress, the author of the pull request who attempts to merge their pull request will receive a warning that there are reviews still in progress. In order to avoid this pull request state, authors should wait until reviews have concluded prior to merging in their pull request.&#xd;
Users who are in the middle of a batch comment review should regularly refresh the page, when prompted by the reload flag, to make sure they are reviewing an updated pull request.</description><createDate>2024-08-23T17:09:34.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Clicking the "Sync now" button at the same time as merging the pull request fails branch restrictions, but may allow the pull request to be merged anyways</summary><key>BCLOUD-23360</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-23360</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Syncing the source branch of a pull request at the same time as the pull request gets merged leaves it in a state where the minimum approvers branch restriction fails, but the PR is merged anyway. There seems to be a race condition between whether or not the sync commit or the merge commit finishes first.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Set up branch restrictions on a branch to merge into that branch via pull requests such that a minimum number of approvals is required and that changing the source branch resets approvals.&#xd;
 # Open a pull request, setting the destination branch as the one with the merge restrictions. Get the minimum number of approvers to approve the pull request.&#xd;
 # Merge the pull request, but at the same time, have another user click the "Sync now" button to update the branch.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The branch restrictions should fail, since updating the source branch reset approvals, and the PR should not be merged.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The branch restrictions fail and pull request approvals are reset. However, the PR still merges anyway.&#xd;

In Bitbucket Pipelines, docker-cached layers from previous builds are not being used in subsequent builds.&#xd;
&#xd;
The docker cache is successfully generated and uploaded in the initial pipeline. It's downloaded in the next step, but it's not used by docker, which is building the layers from scratch.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a pipeline and have a step configured to do a *docker build* , and to use the docker pre-defined cache&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
pipelines:&#xd;
  custom:&#xd;
    test-build-docker-image:&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: Build Docker image&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - docker build .&#xd;
          caches:&#xd;
            - docker&#xd;
          services:&#xd;
            - docker&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
 # Run the pipeline the first time. It will generate a cache with the docker image built layers and upload it to Bitbucket.&#xd;
# Run the pipeline a second time. It will now download the previously generated cache, but docker will not use the cache layers and will build each layer again from scratch.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Docker should use the cached layers from the previous build if no change was applied to that layer in the Dockerfile&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Docker is using the previous cache layers.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior.

&#xd;
Pushing an LFS object using Pipelines default authentication method does not work&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a repository and enable Pipelines on it&#xd;
 # Install LFS and add one file to be tracked as LFS objects. The following yml file is a sample&#xd;
&#xd;
{code:yaml}&#xd;
image: atlassian/default-image:4&#xd;
&#xd;
clone:   lfs: true&#xd;
  &#xd;
pipelines:   &#xd;
    default:     &#xd;
        - step: &#xd;
                name: Default&#xd;
                script: &#xd;
                - echo "Hello World" >> out1.json          &#xd;
                - apt-get update&#xd;
                - apt-get upgrade -y&#xd;
                - apt-get install -y git-lfs&#xd;
                - git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "[skip ci] LFS JSON Push"&#xd;
                - git push&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
3. In the above example, json files are tracked as LFS. Hence, the push contains an LFS object in the commit.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The push is completed&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The Pipeline fails with this error -&#xd;

{noformat}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
It looks like the workspace field is empty and only contains encoded brackets - %7B%7D&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
You can push using other mechanisms such as SSH or App Password. Here is a push command using App Password that has repo read permissions - &#xd;
&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
git push https://$username:$app_password@bitbucket.org/&lt;workspace-id>/&lt;repo-ID>.git&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Pipeline builds fail due to runners crashing with an OutOfMemoryError Java error&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # start an instance with 64 cores&#xd;
 # launch a runner with restricted memory (~1GB)&#xd;
 # run pipelines that generate caches/artifacts until it crashes (100 steps over and over)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If the step memory consumption is low, ideally the runners should execute builds within the allocated memory.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Over time, we should see more and more memory consumed and runners will crash with Java OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
workaround is to assign a minimum number of CPUs, for example: add {{cpus=2}} to the {{docker run}} command to launch runners. This needs to be explicitly added, else default runners assign all available CPUs. In the above-discussed case, it will assign 64 CPUs by default.</description><createDate>2024-03-12T08:03:28.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Uploading files to repository Downloads via API or UI results in error</summary><key>BCLOUD-23114</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-23114</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Parsing test reports where the report have more than 2000 characters per text block or more than 100 test cases, it becomes unresponsive and runs for 120 minutes consuming extra build minutes and leads to having failed pipeline. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Try to create a pipeline with a test report having more than 2000 characters per text block.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Pipeline should complete successfully as normal.&#xd;

&#xd;
Pipeline is stuck at Build Teardown step.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Keep your test reports with the limits of 2000 characters per text block and 100 test cases.&#xd;
 * As a workaround, use after-script to delete the test report xml files that the file size is greater than 30mb. &#xd;
&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
after-script:          &#xd;
  - find app/build/test-results -type f \( -name "*xml" \) -size +30M -delete &#xd;

pipeline build gets completed (passed) without any build logs, It won't run any of the script commands, only running its build setup and build teardown&#xd;
&#xd;
There are a few scenarios where the issue is reproducible. They are mentioned below.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Scenario 1 - /tmp directory is not present on the image that was used for the build&#xd;
 # Scenario 2 - /bin/sh not present on the build image&#xd;
 # Scenario 3 - For Linux Docker runners, the local volume path for /var/lib/docker/containers:ro is likely incorrect&#xd;
 # Scenario 4 - The default docker container user is a "nobody" user, which is often used for running processes with minimal privileges.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The build should fail with an appropriate error message, for example: "Insufficient user permissions."&#xd;

- Occasionally, users report that they receive the following error when executing their runner builds:&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
bash: docker: command not found&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
- This issue is caused by the local Runner directory /tmp/&lt;runner_uuid>/ already containing an empty docker folder. &#xd;
- We are not yet sure why the Runner directory sometimes already contains an empty docker folder (theory is that it's because of an unsuccessful runner configuration that has not cleaned itself up)&#xd;
- Since the docker folder already exists, the Runner fails to mount the new docker directory and the docker binary won't be present during the build.&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: no&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Execute a build within a dockerized Self-hosted Runner&#xd;
 # Observe the error that occurs (this is intermittent - hard to reproduce)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* The build is able to execute&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* The build fails as it is unable to mount the directory&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
* The workaround is described in the following article:&#xd;

It was all out of the blue. Both of them left behind an empty docker directory around the same time: 15:57 and 16:00 GMT.&#xd;
&#xd;
Both runners are sharing the same server, which has 4 runners on it. I'm guessing that if I had enough load, all 4 of them would have shown the symptom.&#xd;
&#xd;
I deleted both empty {{docker}} directories, reran the pipeline, and the pipe failed again, exactly the same way, leaving behind an empty {{docker}} directory.&#xd;

Restarting the runners after deleting the empty directory fixes the issue, and I see an executable file called {{docker}} in there.&#xd;

*Do you know what that looks like?* Looks like what happens when I {{{}docker -v /file/that/does/not/exist:/dest{}}}.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
There is a link to view Workspace Variables in the Repository Variable Settings. This link looks like -&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://bitbucket.org/&lt;workspace-name>/workspace/settings/addon/admin/pipelines/account-variables.&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
!image-2023-08-23-19-35-42-122.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
Clicking on this opens up workspace variables for every user regardless of their workspace permission. For a user who has workspace admin permissions, it does not matter and behaves as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, for a user that does not have workspace admin permissions, the expected behavior is to show a screen that says you do not have permissions since workspace variables are restricted to users with workspace admin access. However, it shows the workspace variable window -&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2023-08-23-19-38-10-495.png|thumbnail!&#xd;
&#xd;
With no other settings visible. This screen is in a read only capacity. You cannot add, edit or delete variables. However, you can see the variables. Additionally, refreshing the page results in a 403. Opening the link in a new tab or copying the link and pasting it in a different window also results in a 403 which is the expected outcome. The problem is when the link is clicked that gives permission to view workspace variables.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a user who has a repository admin access but no workspace admin access&#xd;
 # Go to Repository Settings -> Repository variables&#xd;
 # Click on the Workspace Variables link&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;

When a bitbucket pipeline step fails, and the step contains after-script with same commands as the step's script, the UI will render it incorrectly marking the wrong command as failed.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Use the following bitbucket-pipelines.yml file as example&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
pipelines:&#xd;
  default:&#xd;
     - step: &#xd;
        name: 'Build and Test'&#xd;
        script:&#xd;
          - echo "testing logging "&#xd;
          - exit 1 #force pipeline exit&#xd;
          - sleep 5&#xd;
          - echo "testing 1"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 2"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 3"&#xd;
        after-script:&#xd;
          - echo "testing 1"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 2"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 3"&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
The after-script section has the same commands as the step's script. Also, we are forcing the step to fail with exit 1.&#xd;
# Run the build and the logs will be rendered incorrectly :&#xd;
!image-2023-07-26-12-58-51-935.png|width=286,height=207!&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The builds logs in the UI should render the after-script section correctly, and mark in the read the actual command that failed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Builds logs are marking the wrong command as the one that failed, and also not logging the after script section.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * If possible, make a change in the commands that are exactly the same between after-script and step's script, so they become different. For example :&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
pipelines:&#xd;
  default:&#xd;
     - step: &#xd;
        name: 'Build and Test'&#xd;
        script:&#xd;
          - echo "testing logging "&#xd;
          - exit 1 #force pipeline exit&#xd;
          - sleep 5&#xd;
          - echo "testing 1"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 2"&#xd;
          - echo "testing 3"&#xd;

Currently, if you use the Pipes script ([atlassian/trigger-pipeline|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/trigger-pipeline/src/master/]) to trigger a Pipelines build to another repository while passing a JSON file as variables, Pipelines can only parse variables with the correct casing. It will fail if the incorrect casing has been used in the JSON format.&#xd;

{quote}For now, the best way to deal with creating new repositories within a given workspace is to use workspace access tokens (WAT) instead. This feature is documented here:&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
[https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/using-workspace-access-tokens/]&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
In short, to create one, all you have to do is access the workspace settings (as an admin) and click on access tokens, under "security". You can then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the token creation.&#xd;

You will need to grant the token access to the account, project, and repository scopes for it to be able to create new repos.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Sometimes when a commit is pushed to the repository, the open Pull Request will take time to be updated with the new commit. &#xd;
&#xd;
When you open this pull request, it will detect that the Pull Request source branch is not updated with new commits for which you'll see a banner with an option to Update the PR. This sometimes generates an error because, there's probably an event on the backend already updating the PR for this branch. &#xd;
Eventually the PR will get updated when the backend process updating the PR will be completed.&#xd;
&#xd;
In addition to that this error could be misleading as even though it shows as failed, it would eventually update the PR successfully on the backend. From a user's perspective, it might seem like the PR failed to update the source branch with the latest commits.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
(i) Not easily reproducible. Only reproducible on a specific scenarios depending on the state of the repository&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
PR source branch will be updated with the latest commits&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There is no direct workaround to this issue. However, when the manual update of source branch in the PR fails, it should eventually succeed on the backend, sometime later. You can refresh the PR to check it. </description><createDate>2023-02-20T11:18:37.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Not able to see individual files in Pull Requests when binary files were moved/changed</summary><key>BCLOUD-22438</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-22438</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
According to [Limits for viewing content and diffs|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/limits-for-viewing-content-and-diffs/] , when a pull request exceeds the diff limit, the file diffs should be loaded individually.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, when moving/changing a large binary file in the source branch of a Pull Request, the diff just timeout, and the other small files changed in the source branch are not being loaded individually. Users cannot see the list of what files changed in the UI either.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a few large binary files (~300MB) in the master branch&#xd;
 # Create a feature branch from the master branch&#xd;
 # On the feature branch, move the large binary files to a different folder. Also, create or make small changes to other text files. Push the changes to bitbucket&#xd;
 # Create a Pull Request from the feature branch to the master branch&#xd;
 # Try to load the diff of the pull request&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Pull requests would allow seeing the file diffs individually. Binary diffs would not be shown, but the small text file diffs should be calculated.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The pull request diff times out and the user is not able to see any diff, even for the small text files.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * Push a change to the source branch to remove the binary files from it, as this will likely resolve the diff timeout. Add the binary files in a separate branch where you don't need the diffs to be calculated.&#xd;
 * Convert the binary files to LFS following the instructions of [Migrate a repo to git lfs|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-bfg-to-migrate-a-repo-to-git-lfs/]</description><createDate>2023-01-31T20:20:56.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Runner cache setup and teardown scripts appear to hang where caches contain large numbers of files.</summary><key>BCLOUD-22420</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-22420</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When running a step with a cache, when the cache is downloaded, there is an observed pause in the Build Setup phase where the setup caches script is copying extracted files into the build directory.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
During build teardown, if we are about to upload a cache, the same delay is noticed, where we are copying files into place in preparation to compress the cache.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This copy step can introduce a fair amount of time (noticed on Windows), where 60K files resulted in a minimum of 1 minute delay. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Trigger a step that uses a cache, where the cache is initially empty. Notice during teardown there is a delay where it appears the step has hung.&#xd;
&#xd;
Trigger another step that consumes the cache - noticed there is a delay where it appears Build Setup has hung.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
There should be minimal delay, and/or some feedback to the user indicating what is happening.&#xd;

Jira plugin on Pull Requests page points to old site during Jira site migration and site changes when the issue key is the same&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Link your Bitbucket Workspace to a Jira site&#xd;
# Create a project in the site and then create an issue&#xd;
# Add a commit and a PR with the issue in the title (Make sure the Jira plugin in the PR shows the issue)&#xd;
# Unlink the site and link a new site&#xd;
# Add a new project with the same name and create another issue&#xd;
# You will notice that the commit message and PR title will change the URL to reflect the new site link while the Jira plugin will still point to the old site&#xd;
&#xd;
!image-2022-07-08-21-28-29-348.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
Above screenshot shows the locations where the correct info is shown with the new site but the plugin has old data links which is not the expected outcome. &#xd;
&#xd;
Jira plugin which provides information to the PR page is called “Bitbucket Jira” on the Installed Apps page whereas the plugin that provides the other information is called “Jira”. The Jira plugin shows the correct links whereas Bitbucket Jira shows the wrong links&#xd;
&#xd;
The Jira plugin uses DSS to fetch the information unlike the Bitbucket Jira plugin. If we look at the customer’s apps, we can see the following links - &#xd;
&#xd;
Jira - https://&lt;customer-site-name>.atlassian.net/rest/aci/1.0/installation/jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin/descriptor&#xd;
&#xd;
Bitbucket Jira - https://bb-jira-service.services.atlassian.com/atlassian-connect&#xd;
&#xd;
The bb-jira-service is the same problematic URL for all customers and the cause of the problem. Hence, I can replicate the issue on my end as well. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
The self hosted Bitbucket Pipelines runner can be configured to pull images from ECR, which may involved a call out to the AWS STS service (e.g if trying to pull images using OIDC). When the runner is inside of a private VPC, using VPC endpoints to allow traffic to ECR and STS, the Runner fails trying to pull images.&#xd;
&#xd;
Due to default behaviour of the AWS java sdk ([https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/2362)] , the AWS STS client will always try to use global endpoints despite being configured to use a region. Global endpoints are not accessible from a private VPC (since traffic is restricted out to the public internet). For this to work, the AWS STS client must instead use the regional endpoint.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Push an image into a private ECR registry.&#xd;
 # Configure the necessary IAM and OIDC config to allow the image to be pulled by a Bitbucket Pipelines self hosted Runner.&#xd;
 # Launch a self hosted runner into a private VPC, with private endpoints configured to allow traffic to STS and ECR.&#xd;
 # Run a step that tries to pull an image using OIDC from ECR. The call made to STS to generate credentials to pull the image will fail due to a connection reset error, since the AWS client attempts to talk to STS over the public internet, for which traffic is blocked.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The step should complete successfully.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The step will fail with a connection reset error talking to STS.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Users can allow access from their VPC out to the global STS endpoint. This is not ideal, as it requires from traffic to flow from the private VPC out to the public internet.</description><createDate>2022-05-09T00:26:52.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Community Post [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-discussions/Docker-image-of-self-hosted-uses-global-STS-endpoint-in-AWS/m-p/2022019#M3606?utm_source=dm&amp;utm_medium=unpaid-social&amp;utm_campaign=P:online*O:community*I:social_share*] has also been created for this</text><author>Gerard Menezes</author></comments><comments><text>Also, related to Incident https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/BBS-184006</text><author>Gerard Menezes</author></comments></comments></item><item><summary>PRs are uneditable if a reviewer that no longer has access to the pull request is a reviewer</summary><key>BCLOUD-21777</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21777</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
If pull request has a reviewer added to them that no longer has access to the repository, it's impossible to perform the following actions on that Pull Request:&#xd;
 * Edit the PR title;&#xd;
 * Edit the PR's body&#xd;
 * Merge&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new pull request, and ad some reviewers to it&#xd;
 # Remove one of the reviewers from the repository&#xd;
 # Attempting to perform any of the actions highlighted above will throw a something went wrong error message on the UI. Checking the requests made on the devtools console reveal a message like the following:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
{"type":"error","error":{"fields":{"reviewers":["John Doe is not a member of this workspace and cannot be added to this pull request"]},"message":"reviewers: John Doe is not a member of this workspace and cannot be added to this pull request"}}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If a user is no longer part of a workspace, they will get automatically removed from all Pull requests they are the reviewer of.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user will still show up as a reviewer of the PR even after being removed from the repository, causing all PRs they are added as a reviewer to be blocked until that user is removed.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The current workaround is to remove the reviewer manually from PRs that are blocked due to this problem.&#xd;
&#xd;
This will not work if the reviewer previously approved the PR. In this case, the only workaround is to decline the PR and create a new one.</description><createDate>2022-03-21T09:23:31.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I have this problem and the workaround is not working when the reviewer that no longer has access to the repository has approved the PR, because when trying to remove the user it gives me the error: "You cannot remove reviewers with status"</text><author>cdelfierro</author></comments><comments><text>Similar to https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21506</text><author>Tao Gómez Gil</author></comments><comments><text>The message we got for such a scenario was very vague:&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a Pull Request (PR) is created, the PR Author and Reviewers added should be automatically set as PR Watchers / Followers. This will allow the Reviewer / Author to receive notifications on activities in the PR. &#xd;
&#xd;
We have observed that intermittently, PR Author / Reviewers aren't added to PR Watchers list automatically. This leads to them not receiving notifications on PR Activity&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
(i) Since this is intermittent, it may not be easy to reproduce.&#xd;
&#xd;
# Create a new Pull Request on a repository&#xd;
#* Add Few Reviewers (Including Default Reviewers)&#xd;
# Click Create PR&#xd;
# As the PR Author or Reviewer&#xd;
#* Navigate to the PR page click the "ellipsis" (...) at the top right.&#xd;
#* See if it shows "Watch" or "Stop Watching". &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It shows  "Stop Watching" which indicates you are already watching the PR. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
It shows "Watch" which means as a PR Author or Reviewer, you aren't automatically watching the PR. &#xd;
&#xd;

 # Try to commit the pipeline YAML file, and it will fail with the message: _"Committing file was unsuccessful. You may have restricted write access to the branch."_**&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This happened because the default commit message of the YAML file created when you first commit your pipeline through the UI is "Initial Bitbucket Pipelines configuration". This message cannot be changed, and since it has no *Issue Key*, Bitbucket is not allowing the commit, and showing a generic access issue message.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The correct error message is shown, stating the commit failed because of a missing issue key, and allow commit message to be edited.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The default commit message cannot be changed and a generic error message about branch write permissions was showed.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Manually create the *bitbucket-pipelines.yml* file and push it to the repository with a commit message containing an issue Key.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When merging a pull request through the UI, the merge may appear to fail with a "Something went wrong" error. However, the merge will have been made in the repository even though the pull request remains open.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Merge a pull request with "Close source branch" checked in the merge dialog&#xd;
&#xd;
This behavior is intermittent and rare, so it will be difficult to reproduce consistently.&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The pull request is marked merged, the source branch is merged into the destination branch, and the source branch is closed.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The source branch is merged into the destination branch, but is not closed, and the pull request is not marked as merged.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Pushing or merging an additional commit into either the source or destination branch of the pull request should cause Bitbucket to detect the merge and update the pull request.</description><createDate>2021-10-08T14:45:23.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Source branch is not deleted during automatic merge of a pull request with build checks passed</summary><key>BCLOUD-21327</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21327</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Source branch is not deleted during automatic merge of a pull request with all the build checks passed&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a new branch and make some change&#xd;
 # Make a PR from the newly created branch to the master. enable "source branch deletion".&#xd;
 # Click on the merge button as soon as you create the PR, notice the information in the PR merge you get&#xd;
 # You will observe that Pull request gets merged as soon as the build on the PR become successful&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
After the pull request is merged, the source branch should get deleted.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The source branch shown in the list of Active Branches.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Manually merge PR so that source branch gets deleted. In case of automatic merge, user need to delete the source branch manually.</description><createDate>2021-09-03T06:10:51.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Markdown doesn't render the same way on Source (README) and Wiki page</summary><key>BCLOUD-21269</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21269</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When commenting on a line in a PR the UI says "Sending..." and the comment never gets saved. In the console, under the network tab there the POST to /!api/2.0/repositories/\{username}/\{repo_slug}/pullrequests/\{pull_request_id}/comments/ will return a 500 response.&#xd;
&#xd;
The best way to reproduce this is to comment on a pull request after the destination branch has changed.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Open a PR page for branch XYZ&#xd;
 # Make changes to branch XYZ and push them&#xd;
 # (The already open PR page should be out of date)&#xd;
 # (Open the console and network tab)&#xd;
 # Do a line comment on a PR&#xd;
 # See the 500 error when POST the comment data&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Expect a 200 response and the UI to stop saying "Sending..."&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
500 response and the UI says "Sending..." forever.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Copy the comment text, refresh the PR page and attempt the comment again.</description><createDate>2021-07-14T19:07:58.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Branch and Pull request side by side diff view is showing multiple "undefined" string</summary><key>BCLOUD-21221</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21221</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

&#xd;
Here's a screenshot (Chrome 94 on Mac) comparing the side-by-side diff in a PR vs directly comparing the two branches. It shows lots of lines of `undefined` lines as described in the ticket, but it's worth noting that it also doesn't maintain the correct structure of the file on either side, which makes this view pretty much useless.&#xd;
&#xd;
!https://bytebucket.org/mattwilson1024/bitbucket-diff-bug/raw/68771bc88e69e8ebc15f843d2fca8e40b88fbe33/screenshot.png!&#xd;
&#xd;
Also, if you zoom the browser out with `Cmd -` it fails to draw the right side entirely. (I've tried to add a screenshot for that but Jira is erroring when I upload a second image...)&#xd;
&#xd;
For what it's worth, I'm kind of surprised/disappointed that this issue is marked as such low priority. Diffing two branches is a pretty major part of the product and this bug has rendered side-by-side view completely unusable for quite a while now.&#xd;
&#xd;
When it comes to workarounds, using the non side-by-side view doesn't count as a workaround in my opinion because it's much harder to interpret for large/complex files and that's not achieving the same functionality.&#xd;
&#xd;
Creating a PR does allow you to view the diff properly, but that is inconvenient if you just want to quickly compare two branches, and creates noise for the rest of the team because there's a PR in the list that then needs to be rejected when you're done.</text><author>Matt Wilson</author></comments><comments><text>I agree with Matt, the suggested work around isn't appropriate as it's much harder to interpret. &#xd;

We have the same issue.  I will enter a support ticket with details. &#xd;
&#xd;
As a note, this applies to creating the pull request. &#xd;
&#xd;
I sent instructions in the ticket on how to duplicate the issue. &#xd;
It is happening consistently with us in the following scenario. &#xd;
 # Developer starts to create a pull request&#xd;
 # Since we have a requirement for developers to review changes before submitting the pull request, they select side-by-side to review the pull request. &#xd;
 # “Undefined” appears on lines, normally near the bottom of the file, regardless of blank lines or anything else.  &#xd;
 # Oddly, the behavior does not persist after the pull request is created. &#xd;

&#xd;
If user trigger a deployment in pipeline that contain more than 100 commits(say 200 commits), those Jira issues that only have its key show in 100-200 commits would not get pick up, and the status in the corresponding Jira issue won't be updated.&#xd;

 # Create deployment environments in repository settings -> pipelines -> deployment&#xd;
 # Define a step that mark as deployment, like this:&#xd;

&#xd;
Unfortunately, we don't have a permanent workaround for it except that reduces the commits in the deployment. To do that, you can either break down the deployment into smaller pieces or you can utilise the `squash` function during PR merge, so it won't include that many commits in the deployment.</description><createDate>2021-05-19T05:00:52.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Could you please elaborate on the priority and on the status of this ticket?&#xd;
&#xd;
We have been told by the Atlassian support team to use automation to move our tickets from "Ready for deployment" to "Done" columns. However, this issue means that we can't rely on it, because quite often our releases contain big features which were developed separately and the tickets are not being marked as Deployment production due to only looking at 100 commits.

Issue Summary&#xd;
With the current limitation to our webhook service. Merging a pull request with a large commit message or description fails to trigger an automatic build. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Configure bitbucket-pipelines.yml file to trigger a build when a pull request is merged to target branch&#xd;
# Open a pull request with a large commit message (e.g. 4K lines) or description&#xd;
# Merge the pull request&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Upon merging the pull request a build should automatically trigger on the target branch&#xd;
* Customers should be notified that the payload is too large and has failed to trigger an automatic build. Doing so will provide a better experience overall. At the moment, there is no indication of what a build was not triggered when customers expect a build to trigger automatically. &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* Build is not triggered on the target branch &#xd;
* No indication into why the build was not triggered automatically &#xd;
* This is caused by "Webhook payload is limited to 256 KB. Webhooks may silently fail to trigger if their payload is too large." - Reference: [Troubleshooting webhooks|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/troubleshoot-webhooks/]&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Manually trigger build on the branch: Navigate to the "Branches" page,  then click on the triple dots (...) at the end of the branch, and then "Run pipelines for a branch".</description><createDate>2021-04-29T18:19:00.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Code Search does not include personal workspaces </summary><key>BCLOUD-21020</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21020</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Even if users have access to any personal workspace (outside of their own personal workspace), users will not be able to use the Code Search functionality on those workspaces.&#xd;
The dropdown to select the workspace on the Code Search page will not show personal workspaces, only shared workspaces and the personal workspace of the currently logged-in user.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Get access to any personal workspace (the workspace that is created automatically under your account when you create it) outside of your own personal workspace&#xd;
 # Go to Code Search&#xd;
 # Click on the dropdown to select the workspace - You will be unable to see it there.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
All workspaces that the user has access to must show up on code search.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Personal workspaces do not appear on Code Search's dropdown.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
There are three workarounds here:&#xd;
1. Click on the search icon. Below the search field, you'll see a magnifying glass symbol followed by "Search for code in &lt;current workspace name>". Click on this line. If your current workspace is personal, it will take you to the search page. By default, the personal workspace is selected from the dropdown, although it may not be listed there due to this bug.&#xd;
2. Go directly to the following URL, switching the UUID for the UUID of the workspace that you want to search for:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
https://bitbucket.org/search?account=%7B&lt;UUID>%7D&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
3. Move the repositories from the personal workspace to a shared workspace. This will take some work, but it doesn't require the use of any workaround afterwards.</description><createDate>2021-04-29T14:14:17.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>You are able to commit without issue keys in the message via PR from a forked repository to a repo that has the "Require issue keys in commit messages" enabled</summary><key>BCLOUD-21003</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-21003</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3.

This raises big questions about how these times affect the billing of the monthly pipeline minutes quota. What time does Atlassian actually charge you, CPU or real? If Atlassian charges for real time, why would they report CPU times?&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
When a repository is transferred, and a deployment environment exists with the "Only allow admins to deploy to this environment" restriction activated, admins will be unable to perform deployments to said environment.&#xd;
An error message will state, when attempting to deploy to this environment as an admin, that you do not have access to this environment, regardless of your access level to this repo.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create a deployment environment on a repository, and check "Only allow admins to deploy to this environment". Make sure you are an admin of this repository.&#xd;
 # Transfer the repository where the deployment env was created between workspaces. Make sure to be an admin on the target repo for the transfer&#xd;
 # Attempt to perform a deployment to the target environment&#xd;
 # You will see an error message stating that you are not an admin.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When querying for repository variables and deployments on a repository wit additional results, you will get a pagination with a next URL to query the remaining results.&#xd;
&#xd;
However, for repository variables endpoint, it is providing an incorrect URL such as:&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
https://SOME_INVALID_DOMAIN_HERE/rest/1.0/accounts/...&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
OR&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
https://SOME_INVALID_DOMAIN_HERE/rest/2.0/accounts/...&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
&#xd;
Although the URL endpoint is clearly incorrect, using it throws the following error:&#xd;
 {&#xd;
 "error": {&#xd;
 "data": {&#xd;
 "arguments": {},&#xd;
 "key": "rest-service.rest-service.unauthorized"&#xd;

 }&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
Repository variables:&#xd;
 # Create more than 10 repository variables on a repository&#xd;
 # Run the GET API for /pipelines_config/variables/&#xd;
 # Check the "Next" URL given by the above API&#xd;
&#xd;

# Create multiple deployments in a repository &#xd;
# User the GET method on the {{/2.0/repositories/workspace/repos_slug/deployments/}} endpoint&#xd;
# Check the "Next" URL given by the above API&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The next URL would be given for the /pipelines_config/variables/ or /deployments/ endpoints.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (no)&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
Define a pipeline that meet following condition:&#xd;
 * Have a condition step that would be skip during pipeline execution&#xd;
 * Have steps before condition step that started more than 2 hours, and had a step running 2 hours after pipeline start for more than 5 mins .&#xd;
 * Have step after condition step&#xd;
&#xd;
Here is an example pipeline definition that can reproduce the issue:&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
    reproduce-not-run-state:&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: 1st long running step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - sleep 1h&#xd;
            - sleep 30m&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: 2st long running step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - sleep 1h&#xd;
            - sleep 30m&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: conditional step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - echo "conditional step"&#xd;
          condition:&#xd;

          name: not-run step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - echo "should be in not run state"{code}&#xd;
Pipeline will errored with "Configuration error: The pipeline has entered an unknown state. Please rerun or contact support." after all steps completed before conditional step.&#xd;
&#xd;
This symptom can also happen with pipelines that include manual deployment step:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
    reproduce-not-run-state:&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: 1st round step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - echo "step for 1st run"&#xd;
            - sleep 2m&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: manual deploy&#xd;
          deployment: a&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - echo "manual deploy step"&#xd;
            - sleep 5m&#xd;
          trigger: manual&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: conditional step&#xd;

          condition:&#xd;
            changesets:&#xd;
              includePaths:&#xd;
                - bin/**&#xd;
      - step:&#xd;
          name: not-run step&#xd;
          script:&#xd;
            - echo "should be in not run state" {code}&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Pipeline can complete with out error&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Pipeline is error with: "Configuration error: The pipeline has entered an unknown state. Please rerun or contact support."&#xd;
&#xd;
And step after conditional step is left in NOT_RUN state&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
User can rerun the pipeline and it will continue from first NOT_RUN state</description><createDate>2021-02-04T17:10:03.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>I've seen this A LOT in the past few weeks.</text><author>Jeff</author></comments><comments><text>I agree that this is occurring more frequently.  For me, this seems to happen whenever I have a step (integration tests) that takes longer than 35 minutes, and the subsequent conditional step (apply SQL patches) is skipped, and the following step (push the code live) is manual.  I've even tried to insert a dummy automated step between the integration tests and the SQL patch to see if it helps, but got the same failure today.</text><author>robbytx</author></comments><comments><text>I see the workaround says:&#xd;
{quote}User can rerun the pipeline and it will continue from first NOT_RUN state&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
But my pipeline (ID = \{8b8ead7c-3be2-42ea-9cd1-9da93e9c1f1f}) just got stuck with this, and I have two options – one is to "Rerun failed steps" and the other is to "Rerun entire pipeline". When I click "Rerun failed steps", then the UI just hangs and the network tab shows a 403 response with the body:&#xd;
{code:javascript}&#xd;
{&#xd;
  "error": {&#xd;
    "message": "Forbidden",&#xd;
    "detail": "Can not rerun pipeline because a step is in status PENDING",&#xd;
    "data": {&#xd;
      "key": "result-service.step.invalid-step-rerun-state",&#xd;
      "arguments": {}&#xd;
    }&#xd;
  }&#xd;
}&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
If I click "Rerun entire pipeline", then of course it reruns the entire pipeline. So there is in fact no workaround, other than rerunning the pipeline, and trying to make sure it completes in the allotted time by skipping portions of some steps (in my case, force the pipeline to skip running integration tests).</text><author>robbytx</author></comments><comments><text>My use case is that our integration tests take time and are costly so we run them on branches before merge, and then we run them once on the main branch before releasing to Production. But not everything that merges to main gets pushed to Production – that's a manual decision and performed at an off-peak time – and we have a conditional step to apply SQL patches to the production database, so that's how we end up in this state.&#xd;
&#xd;
Here's a summary of the main branch pipeline:&#xd;
 # Initial: Build the code&#xd;
 # Auto: Deploy to QA (Staging) environment&#xd;
 # Manual: Run integration tests in all our target browsers&#xd;
 # Condition (also Manual): Apply SQL patches to Production DB&#xd;
 # Manual: Deploy to Production environment&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
API Calls that take more than 30 seconds fail with HTTP 500 instead of timeout message&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make an API call that would take more than 30 seconds (ex: huge commits messages)&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
# a timeout error is shown &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
# HTTP 500 error&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
No workaround as this is a limitation of Bitbucket API&#xd;
&#xd;
*EDIT* Can this API timeout limit be increased past 30 seconds? For users with large workspaces who need to make calls to list repositories/users, the amount of JSON data returned in the HTTP response can actually cause this timeout to occur and does not support scalability very well.</description><createDate>2021-01-13T17:40:28.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This affects a large enterprise in the finance industry that we provide with a pull request workflow solution.&#xd;

There is a work-around for [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-20733] to make this {*}performant{*}: workaround is to use the {{exclude_members=true}} querystring param. This will then list all of the groups without members, which is {*}performant{*}. Then, for each group get the members with a separate API request.&#xd;
&#xd;
Fetch all groups from [https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/groups/|https://bitbucket.org/!api/1.0/groups/]&lt;workspace>?exclude_members=true&#xd;

I maintain a popular utility called [{{git-open}}|http://github.com/paulirish/git-open] which opens a browser to your bitbucket/github/gitlab to view whatever branch you have checked out.

Bitbucket makes this pretty difficult if there&amp;#x27;s a slash in the branch name. (Which it surprisingly common :)

----
For example, in the {{Guyzmo/git-repo}} project, following [the official docs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/hyperlinking-to-source-code-in-bitbucket-824476709.html] I can view the {{devel}} branch with this URL:\\
[{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/devel}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/devel]

Easy enough, but here&amp;#x27;s the problem:

For the {{bugfix/conftest_fix}} branch, bitbucket provides a 404 for a similar URL: [{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix/conftest_fix}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix/conftest_fix]\\
And we get the same result if we URL-encode the slash: [{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix%2Fconftest_fix}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix%252Fconftest_fix]

_When using the site to view the branch we get a {{/src/&lt;commit hash>/?at=&lt;branch/name>}} URL.  So while this is a workaround, it makes for more awkward ergonomics. :/_

----
Ideally, a fix would make either of the above 404&amp;#x27;ing URLs start to work.

With the new source browser view, a link of this form _still does not work_ *if* the {{BRANCHNAME}} contains one or more {{/}} characters. (As @paulirish reported, URL-encoding the slash in the branch name makes no difference; still broken.)

bq. I&amp;#x27;ve re-opened this ticket, as it is something we want to explore supporting as we continue to work on the new source browsing experience.


It seems like the solution should be just as simple as (percent-decode the branch name from the URL" before feeding it into {{git rev-parse}})… thereby allowing the web view to handle branch names with slashes, or any other unusual characters in them.

E.g. decode the branch portion of {{https://bitbucket.org/OWNER/REPO/src/BRANCH/PATH/FILE.EXT}} so that {{BRANCH=&amp;#x27;feature/cr%C3%B6mul%C3%A8nt%C3%9Franchname&amp;#x27;}} will lookup the Git branch named {{feature/crömulèntßranchname}}. This is the standards-compliant way of allowing {{/}} characters in URL path components.

While this issue is still in progress and not resolved, any chance the docs page could be updated also to reflect "/" characters not being supported?: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/hyperlink-to-source-code-in-bitbucket/ &#xd;

It is a fairly standard practice to group branches under a "something/" prefix, and it therefor seems list a pretty large omission to not have this called out in the docs.&#xd;

For me this is a major bug because I use gitflow and group by branches with "feature/" and other prefixes. Also your sourcetree tool support this kind of grouping.&#xd;

{code:java}&#xd;
When using the site to view the branch we get a /src/&lt;commit hash>/?at=&lt;branch/name> URL. So while this is a workaround, it makes for more awkward ergonomics.{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
This could be made a viable workaround if we could use meta {color:#0747a6}{{&lt;commit>}}{color} like {color:#0747a6}{{HEAD}}{color} or maybe {color:#0747a6}{{latest}}{color} instead of the hash. But I suspect the {color:#0747a6}{{?at=&lt;branch>}}{color} doesn't actually scope anything but just sets the picker box on the page, so that may not be an easy fix either.&#xd;

&#xd;
Not being able to link to a branch in documentation is disastrous for my team. We had someone follow a link which included an old commit hash and chaos cascaded. This is NOT a cosmetic issue. It is crippling. I've had to self host a repo webserver while we wait for a solution.&#xd;

I'm using Confluence cloud Asciidoc macro to load an Asciidoc file from Bitbucket to Confluence. On branches without slash on their name I can link a file in a branch, so the latest commit is always loaded regardless of how many commits are pushed, but when there is slash on the name, I have to update all pages using Asciidoc with Bitbucket and slash as source branch, meaning when updating the repository I have to also manually update the source url in the Confluence macros, meaning it is so impractical that I would consider it impossible for humans without external scripts.</text><author>Jimi Viita-aho EFECTE</author></comments><comments><text>For some reason, the urlencode trick works when viewing raw files.

&#xd;
Note this behaviour was working previously, but stopped working at some point, so it appears to be a regression in Bitbucket Cloud.</text><author>David Arnold</author></comments><comments><text>Hello [~darnold3],&#xd;
&#xd;
This currently works as it was designed, let me explain why.&#xd;
&#xd;
The relation between Jira and Bitbucket is established not on the _project – repository_ level but rather on the _instance (site) – workspace_ level. So, all repositories of a Bitbucket workspace become “available” in any project of a Jira site. Moreover, there might be multiple workspaces connected to the same Jira site (and vice versa, but that’s out of scope right now).&#xd;
&#xd;
So, with the current state of things *Create branch* action in the _Development tools_ indeed brings you to the so called _global_ branch creation screen in Bitbucket, where aside from the branch type and name you also need to select a repository to create it in. When we worked on that screen, we decided not to limit the choice of repositories (as users might wonder why it is limited) but rather help by preselecting the relevant repository based on the Jira issue they came from. Does this make sense?&#xd;
&#xd;
We did that by storing the repository which user selected for the given Jira project last time, so next time they want to create a branch against an issue from the same project, we use that information and preselect the same repository from the list. Unfortunately, the implementation of this last bit is becoming suboptimal. These days the browsers are enforcing the rules around expiration time of the local storage records, and the problem is that local storage is where we store the relation between Jira project and last selected repository which I described above. So my guess would be that you face missing saved last repository selection and hence have to pick the repository again.&#xd;
&#xd;
I will keep this ticket open to reflect the status of a fix for the local storage expiration time issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
Cheers,&#xd;

h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Call the Reports API endpoint to create Pipeline reports as mentioned in the [API documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bcommit%7D/reports/%7BreportId%7D]&#xd;

We get BRANCH_PERMISSION_VIOLATED error.&#xd;
h3. Steps to reproduce the error:&#xd;
 * Create oAuth for the TEAM workspace atlas_team123&#xd;

curl -X POST -u key:secret https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=client_credentials&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Create repo_bbs repository in atlas_team123 TEAM account&#xd;
 * Setup branch permission for *release/** branch and give Administrators group only write access in atlas_team123/repo_bbs&#xd;
 * Administrators group has only one individual account and not TEAM workspace atlas_team123&#xd;
 * Make an API call to create a branch using the access token for atlas_team123 TEAM account &#xd;

curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlas_team123/repo_bbs/refs/branches' -A 'bitbucket-api-client/1.1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxx' -X POST -d '{"name":"release\/20.20.20","target":{"hash":"master"}}'&#xd;

&#xd;
This is because we have a branch permission to restrict access to certain users only and team accounts/workspace cannot be added as users in the branch permission.&#xd;
&#xd;
Hence even though the team account/workspace is the owner of the repository the team account's OAuth cannot be used to create the restricted branch.&#xd;
&#xd;
This affects the customers as they need to add a service account to the group that has branch permission and use the service account's OAuth credentials to create the branch.&#xd;
&#xd;
It would be good to have the ability to use the team account/workspace OAuth instead.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When you use your credentials to authenticate via API, the same logged in credential on UI session gets logged out. This is an intermittent issue and does not happen all the time.&#xd;
&#xd;
Example : Intermittently making any API request using a credential, the browser session which is logged in via the same user shows "Something Went Wrong". A refresh shows that the account is logged out.&#xd;
 * The Atlassian Account is still logged in&#xd;
 * Only Bitbucket Account is logged out.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Login to Bitbucket and open Repository in Source View&#xd;
 # Create a PR via API Request using same username and password as you are logged in the browser. (POST or GET) - It does not seem specific to PR API, It could be other API as well.&#xd;
 # Navigate to another view on the Bitbucket UI. Example : on your Bitbucket repository Source View, click Pull Request on the UI, you will see "Something Went Wrong"&#xd;
 # Refresh the page and see that you're logged out.&#xd;
 # Click Login and you are redirected back into the account without prompting credentials&#xd;
 ** This indicates that the Atlassian Account session was still valid as opposed to Bitbucket Account Session&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * Regardless of using the same credential on API request, the UI session shouldn't get logged out&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * User session gets logged out on the UI&#xd;
 * Console shows the following error :&#xd;

# Add a user to a user group in an account which has access to Private Repositories&#xd;
# Mark that user account as Inactive (probably a *temporary* account deletion to de-activate the account to simulate the scenario)&#xd;
# Access  "Users on Plan" view and you'll see the same user on the list of users. &#xd;
# Access "Plan Details" view and you'll see that the user count is lower than the list of users on "Users on Plan" as it excludes the inactive users.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
It's expected to not include to Inactive users on the "Users on Plan" view. This should match the number of users displayed on "Plan Details".&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The "Inactive User" is shown in "Users on Plan View"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
There's no workaround for this View.</description><createDate>2020-02-20T00:32:22.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Garbage file intermittently counted in the repository size</summary><key>BCLOUD-19794</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-19794</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
Garbage file is intermittently counted in the repository size.&#xd;
&#xd;
When pushing to the remote repository a GC is triggered afterwards which generates a garbage file. This garbage file is cleared on the next subsequent GC.&#xd;
Between those two GC's the size of the repository is displayed incorrectly within Bitbucket UI as the garbage file size is intermittently counted towards the repository total size.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Push files to the remote&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
* Local repository size match the repository size of the remote.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
* Repository size of the remote is larger than what is seen locally.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Workaround is to request support to run a GC or wait until the next iteration of the GC is run after a push.&#xd;
If the repository size + the garbage file size is over 2GB, which is our hard limit for repository size, the repository will be set in read only state and users will not be able to push any further and will necessarily require support assistance to clear their repository size.</description><createDate>2020-01-14T20:25:16.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>API and Git operations made within Pipelines build is blocked by IP whitelisting</summary><key>BCLOUD-19689</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-19689</url><type>Bug</type><priority>null</priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
At this time, if a user clones another repository from the same workspace in pipelines with IP whitelisting enabled, they are required to whitelist the whole IP range that belongs to Bitbucket Pipelines. Considering the fact that both repositories in question belong to the same *premium workspace,* Can't the IP whitelisting feature be overridden in such cases? Or, could there be an option to just whitelist a set of repositories?&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 * Enable IP whitelisting on the workspace 'ABC'&#xd;
 * Go to repo 'A' and configure pipelines to clone the repo 'B'. Both repo 'A' and 'B' belongs to workspace 'ABC'&#xd;
 * The pipeline will error out with the following error: "{color:#ff8b00}_To access this repository, an admin must whitelist your IP._{color}"&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * Both repositories are part of the same workspace, therefore cloning another repo from the same workspace should be allowed and IP whitelisting check should be overridden.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
 * The user is required to add the Bitbucket pipelines IP range to the IP whitelisting section before cloning another repo within pipelines on the same workspace.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * To add the Bitbucket pipelines IP range to the IP whitelisting section&#xd;

Effectively it would grant all Pipelines builds access (at least visibility) to the workspace - which the whitelisting tries to avoid. &#xd;
This is may be acceptable for some customers that use whitelisting, but others might prefer the whitelisting to be respected in a more strict manner.  </text><author>Jeroen De Raedt</author></comments><comments><text>Hi all, is there any update on this?&#xd;
&#xd;
Adding 15 IP addresses to the IP Whitelist is a very hard sell for our company, it's quite a security risk. We require private repos, and the submodules we use are also within the same workspace. It seems odd that we have to whitelist external IP addresses (from my company's perspective) to make the build pipeline work.</text><author>Carl Cook</author></comments><comments><text>Just to add some more details here, it looks like the list of addresses recently changed.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When I search "backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee" in the Bitbucket code search I retrieve inline code result that matched the string as shown in the screenshot 1.png&#xd;
&#xd;
When I change the search to "tu.ts.egym.coffee" I retrieve only files whose name has "tu.ts.egym.coffee", it does not show the file which has words that match tu.ts.egym.coffee&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # In the code search, search for  *backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee*, it will show the file which has the string backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee. See screenshot 1.png&#xd;
 # If you search for *tu.ts.egym.coffee*, it shows only files whose name has tu.ts.egym.coffee, but not the file which has the string backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee&#xd;

h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When you search for *tu.ts.egym.coffee*, it should show files whose name has tu.ts.egym.coffee and also the file which has the string backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee &#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
When you search for *tu.ts.egym.coffee*, it shows only files whose name has tu.ts.egym.coffee, but not the file which has the string backend.tu.ts.egym.coffee &#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
1. Search for *tu\.ts\.egym\.coffee* instead of *tu.ts.egym.coffee*, ** it works as expected.&#xd;
&#xd;
See screenshot 3.png&#xd;
&#xd;
2. for the syntax with Class1.Class2RRRR, we suggest using the same syntax as a phrase search, in the following way: "Class1 Class2" this should help with finding the results you are looking for until our team addresses this issue. </description><createDate>2019-11-20T13:20:22.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>We just noticed that *tu\.ts\.egym\.coffee* also does not lead to the expected result.

To tag images. One tool picks up commit hash. Then pipeline tries to fetch image by full commit hash which (SURPRISE) sometimes full, sometimes not.

We don’t allow users to define multiple steps within the same pipeline which deploy to the same environment. If you’re interested in multi-step deployments, I suggest you vote for issue BCLOUD-18261 which is the open ticket tracking this request.

Our UI validator is actually incorrect in saying that this is valid configuration. I’ve raised a ticket in our backlog to fix this issue and will rename this ticket so that’s I’ve raised a ticket to fix the bug with our validator.

Engineering Manager - Bitbucket Cloud</text><author>Tom Kane</author></comments><comments><text>Yikes. It took a little bit too long to figure out that _this_ was the issue we've been having with LFS. Implementation should be as easy as "don't enforce SSH keys on read-only service accounts"-- if that's not an easy fix, I'm sure I'd be terrified of whatever implementation is under the hood. The main reason we use a cloud-based remote repository hosting provider like Bitbucket is to avoid wasting time on engineering solutions for source-hosting when we should be focusing on our project source. Our hope is that this will get resolved quickly (it's been over 5 months since the last reply at this point, and over two years since the ticket was opened in the first place), because if we have to sacrifice security and/or start working on debugging the hosting platform itself, we'll probably just save time and costs and go back to self-hosting.</text><author>Caleb Power</author></comments><comments><text>This is forcing us to keep 2FA disabled, which is not desirable...</text><author>Guillem Vela</author></comments><comments><text>"We are currently looking into the best way to resolve this issue without sacrificing security."&#xd;

Could you try looking a bit harder?

This is highlighted in this example public repository: https://bitbucket.org/rtest123/anchor-indentation/addon/pipelines/home#!

Added by [~tboudale] :

I would also like to add that sometimes a YML anchor also breaks validation in other parts of the yml file.

E.g.

{code}
definitions: 
  steps:
    - step: &amp;build-test
      name: Build and test
      script:
        - echo "hello"
      artifacts:
        - target/**

pipelines:
  branches:
    anchor:
      -step: *build-test
    master:
      - step: *build-test

{code}

Above^ the lack of a space between &amp;#x27;-&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;step&amp;#x27; for the branch named &amp;#x27;anchor&amp;#x27;, is not indicated by the validator.</description><createDate>2019-03-08T12:10:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Thanks for raising this.

This configuration resulted in an error when the pipeline was executed because when the reference was expanded, we detected the pipeline didn&amp;#x27;t include some keywords that it was expecting.

I&amp;#x27;ve created a ticket in the team&amp;#x27;s backlog to look at this bug, however, this is low priority given the other things that we&amp;#x27;re working on. I&amp;#x27;ll update you on our progress on this bug via this ticket.

If several iterations for pull requests , for example twice failed and then last fix passed. The symbol will be red although last build passed and has green symbol. Because it contains history will failures the summarized symbol will be red</text><author>Norbert Csupka</author></comments><comments><text>This looks like an issue where the 2 builds are actually separate builds, so the second one uses a different `key` and thus the build status API sees this as 2 builds, one of which has failed (which rolls-up as red), rather than 1 build that ran twice, of which the second one passed (which should roll-up as green).&#xd;
&#xd;
The docs here: [https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit/%7Bnode%7D/statuses/build] could be a bit clearer - if the `key` is the same, then the later status represents a re-run of the same build and thus it reports as green. If the keys are different, they are 2 separate builds.</text><author>mwatson</author></comments><comments><text>There needs to be an option for pull-request triggered builds to show only the latest build status in the pull-request screen. Even though the latest build was successful, my pull-request screen shows build failure (red icon) just because the first build on the pull-request was a failure. The developer goes back to fix the failure, fixes it and commits it, the pull-request gets updated with everything but the build status stays red even as the build passes after the fix. &#xd;

I guess this needs resolving ASAP.&#xd;

&#xd;
Just wanted to give an update on this ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
We did a spike on supporting this and found that allowing for variables with “.” characters lead to some significant inconsistencies in usability. The root issue is that a “.” in a variable key is not fully POSIX compliant, and thus different shells and commands handle this case in significantly different ways.&#xd;
&#xd;
As a very quick example, running `echo $DOT.VARIABLE` in Shell or Bash would evaluate `$DOT` as a variable and then append `.VARIABLE` verbatim, rather than evaluate `$DOT.VARIABLE` as a whole. Though there are some scenarios where this does work as expected, such as how Elasticsearch reads the variables.&#xd;
&#xd;
As far as I can tell from this ticket, this feature was needed primarily for the Elasticsearch Docker image. And Elasticsearch has offered a workaround for this problem: [https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/74036]&#xd;
&#xd;
For example `discovery.type` would become `ES_SETTING_DISCOVERY_TYPE`. Can you let me know if that works for you?&#xd;
&#xd;
Please let us know if there’s other use-cases that are blocked by this feature and we can review if necessary.&#xd;

Consequently, our webhooks began to fail last week (November 30th) as did [many other users|BCLOUD-17668] with NET_ERR or 403s. We resolved this by adding the full list of *58* public IPs, however, this seems unreasonable. If a request commonly originates from something outside the original list, is that list even meaningful?

As IPs can and will change (as they have done in the past and [is documented on their firewall page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/what-are-the-bitbucket-cloud-ip-addresses-i-should-use-to-configure-my-corporate-firewall-343343385.html]). We can check and maintain 3 or so, but 58 IPs? That&amp;#x27;s painful, unless we write a script maintain firewalls.

Even then it does not seem very secure to have literally dozens of end points we have to white list. Yes we have private/public keys, yes we have passwords, yes we limit ports, but we rather have a small and maintainable IP list (or at the very least one that is not a misleading list).</description><createDate>2018-12-04T23:39:20.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This is paining us too.

On the receiving end, an AWS security group can only take 60 rules so even with automation this is getting dicey.

On the sending side, I notice the IPs in the list of 58 that I checked are AWS ones. I would think with elastic IPs, which stay the same, and such, even with two or three regions and a private data center, something could be made to work with a handful of fixed addresses.
</text><author>Piers S</author></comments><comments><text>Same here, this is madness! I don&amp;#x27;t want to have to create a cron job to keep track of an ever changing list of 50+ public IP addresses to whitelist. I can not make my Jenkins server public either because that&amp;#x27;s just asking for trouble. This has effectively rendered my webhooks _useless_. This is a show stopper for us using Bitbucket because we absolutely need triggered events. Github is looking like an attractive option now:

"hooks": [\\
"192.30.252.0/22",\\
"185.199.108.0/22",\\
"140.82.112.0/20"\\
]

I don&amp;#x27;t normally resort to snark but this really is putting a damper on my work, so thanks for making my life more difficult! I look forward to a resolution or we will discontinue use of Bitbucket permanently.

I&amp;#x27;m using TSLint to generate a Junit XML file to be reported on by Pipelines.

However, when I run my builds and the XML I&amp;#x27;ve attached to this ticket gets generated in a folder called &amp;#x27;test-reports&amp;#x27;, I get the following messaging from Pipelines:

_Searching for test report files in directories named [test-results, failsafe-reports, test-reports, surefire-reports] down to a depth of 4\\
Found matching test report file /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/test-reports/lint.xml\\
Located test suite containing 0 tests, with 0 failures and 0 errors.\\
Located test suite containing 0 tests, with 0 failures and 0 errors.\\
Finished scanning for test reports. Found 1 test report files.\\
Merged test suites, total number tests is 0, with 0 failures and 0 errors._

Pipelines appears to be locating the file correctly and it&amp;#x27;s even managed to determine that there are two test suites. However, it doesn&amp;#x27;t appear to have noticed that there are some tests in these suites and some of them are failing (as per the XML).

The only difference I&amp;#x27;ve found between this Junit XML output by TSLint and that of something like a Jest JUnit output is that this is missing some attributes (such as success/failure). However, I would have thought that Pipelines would have been able to infer these figures from the hierarchy?</description><createDate>2018-10-17T23:40:17.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>@jxadamb, what TSLint library are you using to generate these results? I can see from the report that each &lt;testsuite> is missing count, failure and error attributes, which we currently use in parsing of test results. If count is empty or 0, we don&amp;#x27;t parse the tests within the testsuite. Whether this is a bug in our test parsing, or a bug with the TSLint lib tooling is still to be determined. Potentially, we could infer these counts based on the contents of the test report file to be more robust against xml reports that don&amp;#x27;t include these totals.

You&amp;#x27;re correct in your assessment though, technically this can be seen as either a bug or an improvement, depending on wether you classify the counts as required. The Junit XML spec obviously documents them being there but it would be good in the case of some Junit XML exporters not adding the totals, for them to be inferred.

{code:java}&#xd;
Error processing tar file(exit status 1): Container ID 165586 cannot be mapped to a host ID&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
I can't figure out which part is failing, though from browsing other issues it appears to be some issue with user remapping. However, the only existing issues I can find that sound similar are to do with multistage builds. The build is failing some time after the {{apt-get autoremove}} in the following:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
# Copy requirements in&#xd;
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/&#xd;
COPY requirements/ /app/requirements/&#xd;
&#xd;

&#xd;
Identifying the right owner of the file/folders being exchanged between Docker containers that result in the error "Container ID cannot be mapped to a host ID" during a pipeline run?&#xd;
{panel}&#xd;
(i) This is important in resolving related issues, as once the file(s)/folder(s) are identified. Their ownership can be changed to 'root' in order to avoid the resulting error.&#xd;
&#xd;
Example error: _"Container ID 165569 cannot be mapped to a host ID_" we can make an initial conclusion that the container ID *165569* is unable to map with the host ID. It is important to get the right user ID on the host container from the child container ID *165569* pointing to. Steps below help to find the same:&#xd;
----&#xd;
Docker user namespace configurations are stored within the following two files '/etc/subuid' and '/etc/subgid', which looks as follows on Bitbucket Pipelines:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
pipelines:100000:65536&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
For instance, with "*pipelines:100000:65536*" it means that user *pipelines* can use 65536 user ids starting at 100000. Now a user ID 165569 on a host container would refer to *165569 - (100000+65536) = 33*&#xd;
&#xd;
After getting the host user ID, you can use the following command to find all the files that belong to it:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
RUN find / -uid 33 -ls&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Ideally, for a multi-stage build and DinD setup, the easiest trick to make everything working is by changing the ownership of the folder to *root* that is failing to get copied to the child container:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
chown -R root:root file/folder{code}&#xd;

</text><author>Joël Wijngaarde</author></comments><comments><text>As a part of the ongoing security hardening process in Bitbucket Pipelines, we decided to enable [docker user namespace remap|https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/] to eliminate potential *security* risks that might affect our users.&#xd;
&#xd;
This change affected a small percentage of users using docker in their builds. So, we wanted to share the different limitations that this change introduced, and the actions required to make your builds work with the security enhancement introduced.&#xd;
h2. Issues caused by limitations of userns remap.&#xd;
&#xd;
As mentioned in the docker documentation linked above, enabling docker userns remap introduces the following limitations:&#xd;
&#xd;
The following standard Docker features are incompatible with running a Docker daemon with user namespaces enabled:&#xd;
{quote}* sharing PID or NET namespaces with the host (--pid=host or --network=host).&#xd;
{quote} * external (volume or storage) drivers which are unaware or incapable of using daemon user mappings.&#xd;
 * Using the --privileged mode flag on docker run without also specifying --userns=host.&#xd;
&#xd;
We already disallowed on pipelines {{-{-}pid=host{-}}} and {{-privileged-}} containers however {{-network=host}} is a new limitation.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the interim we have added all users who currently use this feature of docker (as indicated by our analytics) to an exclusion list.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will be making changes to docker to assist you in moving from using {{--network=host}} to a solution that will involve you using container links, port mapping and providing a similar feature to docker for OSX with a host that resolves to the host for the build.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will release further communications as to when these changes will be made and the exclusion list will be removed.&#xd;
h2. Docker build, removing files doesn't remove them.&#xd;
&#xd;
Due to bugs in docker, when files were modified (removed/alterered) during a docker build via RUN/COPY commands the changes weren't being reflected in subsequent layers.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have upgraded docker to pull in the fix for these issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
[https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/36648]&#xd;
&#xd;
[https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35709]&#xd;
&#xd;
[https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32919]&#xd;
&#xd;
[https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30110]&#xd;
&#xd;
However some failures require user intervention, as some commands were modifying the UID/GID (similar to the error below). For these situations docker now supports {{--chown}} as an argument to some dockerfile commands.&#xd;
h2. Builds fails due to error: “Container ID Cannot Be Mapped to Host ID Error”&#xd;
&#xd;
Due to the way userns remap works (by remapping UID/GIDs to another less privileged UID/GID in the hosts namespace), UID/GIDs that are placed on files must be in the range 0-65535.&#xd;
&#xd;
If you recieve this error, you will need to perform a fix on the image that has this invalid UID/GID.&#xd;
&#xd;
If your recieved this error against a file that you created and placed into an image, the fix is to simply change the UID/GID of the file to one within the range.&#xd;
&#xd;
To find the file, first get the invalid UID/GID from the error message and run the following command on the files within the container.&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
find / '(' -uid &lt;invalid-uid-or-guid> -or -gid &lt;invalid-uid-or-guid> ')'  -ls {code}&#xd;
To fix the ownership of the file use the following command&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
chown -R UID_IN_RANGE:GID_IN_RANGE filename&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
If you received this error against a file that was already present in a layer of the base image you depend on, you will need to raise a support case and work with the image maintainers of the base image to get this resolved.&#xd;
h2. Test containers&#xd;
&#xd;
If you use the java library test containers there is currently a bug in that it doesn't run against a docker daemon with userns remap enabled.

As the pinned post above suggested we are removing the ability to be whitelisted to work around these issues (as we need to leave the change in place for security purposes).

I have written this post however to assist you in fixing these issues for good in your builds (so they can continue to run in docker both with and without user namespace remapping).

</text><author>lassian</author></comments><comments><text>Hey @nburrell , would help if you or your team actually read these messages. The "Container ID Cannot Be Mapped to Host ID Error” we are getting is not for a single file, as your pinned post suggests. And simply flagging it as a problem with the base image doesn&amp;#x27;t help any of us relying on python.
</text><author>Ashvin Narayanan</author></comments><comments><text>This will probably get worse for python repos as those with pip cache optimizations cycle through caches: I am assuming that the cache feature is unaffected, yet when the cache is out of date or deleted, the image will then be subject to this change.

The solution of finding the files in the image is null for pip installs.  There appears to be a process where pip may have intermediate files in userns sensitive areas in the setup process that are then deleted.  This makes it impossible to find the files dynamically.

For a work-around (python pip installers with issues), try using the pip --target flag to control where this process takes place:

{code}
#!python

RUN mkdir -p /src
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --target=/src -r requirements.txt
RUN export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/src
{code}

This way /src should already be user mappable, though you may have to chown of the /src directory.

your solution does not work at all:

To find the file, first get the invalid UID/GID from the error message and run the following command on the files within the container.

{code}
find / -uid|-gid &lt;invalid-uid-or-guid> -ls

To fix the ownership of the file use the following command

</text><author>abdulachik</author></comments><comments><text>Looks like {{userns}} is not ready for production use given the way is breaks normal Docker builds. We would like to evaluate Pipelines but all of our builds are Docker multi-stage builds so everything is going to be broken right now :cry:

Note that this issue doesn&amp;#x27;t affect Docker in Docker build systems that don&amp;#x27;t use {{userns}}. AWS CodeBuild lets you run multi-stage, and and even {{--priveledged}} builds if you must, without this issue. The downside there is that build layer caches only last hours there whereas Pipelines will keep caches for a week. You can work around that by [pulling your previous builds as caches|https://github.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images/issues/26#issuecomment-386913125] and this might also be useful for larger Bitbucket Pipeline builds since layer caches are limited to 1GB.

{code}&#xd;
To answer some [potential] questions in advance:&#xd;
 * a specific UID is needed for an app running under Tomcat and its requirement to write to a specific folder outside of `/usr/local/tomcat`&#xd;
 * multi-stage build helped to save about 300MB in the final image (870 vs 578MB)&#xd;

This is what I got from Atlassian on a support ticket I opened for this a few days ago&#xd;
{noformat}&#xd;
Docker user namespace configurations are stored within the following two files '/etc/subuid' and '/etc/subgid', which looks as follows on Bitbucket Pipelines:pipelines:100000:65536&#xd;
For instance, with "pipelines:100000:65536" it means that user pipelines can use 65536 user ids starting at 100000. Now a user ID 165569 on a host container would refer to 165569 - (100000+65536) = 33, which is the following user in your case "www-data".{noformat}&#xd;
In my case the error mentioned user id 165569, which points to my container user id 33 as per pipelines settings. This was confirmed to have to do with user namespacing in pipelines, which is technically a security feature.&#xd;
&#xd;
In my case, the effect was that I could only run build steps that require file changes in the container as "root", but in the last steps of my build I could change ownership to the final intended user (www-data).&#xd;
&#xd;
It does feel like a workaround though.&#xd;

Edit: Fixed markdown strikethroughs.</text><author>Joshua Kellendonk</author></comments><comments><text>My problem was precisely the same as Andrei's (i.e. www-data). Originally:&#xd;
 * My intermediate stage created files with www-data ownership&#xd;
 * A later stage copied those www-data owned files (which failed on Bitbucket Pipelines for the reasons noted above).&#xd;
&#xd;
My fix was:&#xd;
 * In the intermediate stage, change ownership back to "root:root"&#xd;
 * On the later stage, copy the files but chown back to "www-data:www-data", e.g. either via separate RUN command or with the "--chown=..." parameter in the COPY command.&#xd;
&#xd;
*TL;DR:* Ensure the permissions are finally *root:root* in the intermediate stage _prior to moving on_ to subsequent stages, then ensure you update permissions back (if necessary).&#xd;

For example. Let's say following line was created file with a different owner &#xd;

{code:java}&#xd;
RUN curl https://example.com/example.tar.gz | tar xvz &#xd;

{code}&#xd;
if introduces a conditional clause More (Definitions, Synonyms, Translation)</text><author>Zogoo</author></comments><comments><text>TL;DR: Start from your baseimage and check for the ID that is creating the problem using commands in your dockerfile. Use "problem_id = error_message_id - 100000 - 65536" to find the uid or gid that is not supported. Chown copies the files that are modified inflating your docker image.&#xd;
&#xd;
The details:&#xd;
&#xd;
We were using base image tensorflow/tensorflow:2.2.0-gpu and though we tried to find the problem ourselves, we were looking too late in our Dockerfile and making assumptions that were wrong.With help from Atlassian support we found that /usr/local/lib/python3.6 contained many files belonging to group staff (gid = 50)&#xd;
&#xd;
*Assumption 1*: Bitbucket pipelines have definitions for the standard "linux" user ids and group ids.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Reality*: Bitbucket pipelines only define a subset of the standard users and groups. Specifically they do not define group "staff" with gid 50. Your Dockerfile base image may define group staff (in /etc/groups) but the Bitbucket pipeline is run in a docker container without that gid. DO NOT USE&#xd;
{quote}RUN cat /etc/group &amp;&amp; RUN /etc/passwd&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
to check for ids. Execute these commands as Bitbucket pipeline commands in your script.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Assumption 2*: It was something we were installing that was breaking the build.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Reality*: Although we could "move the build failure around" by adjusting which packages we installed. This was likely just a case of some packages overwriting the ownership of pre-existing&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
We were able to find the files by using the relationship between the id in the error message and the docker build id of&#xd;
{quote}problem_id = error_message_id - 100000 - 65536&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
And used the computed id value (50) to fined the files early in our Dockerfile:&#xd;
{quote}RUN find / -uid 50-ls&#xd;
 RUN find / -gid 50 -ls&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
For example: &#xd;
{quote}Error processing tar file(exit status 1): Container ID 165586 cannot be mapped to a host ID&#xd;
 50 = 165586 - 100000 - 65536&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
*Final solution* (for us):&#xd;
&#xd;
Adding this command early to our Dockerfile: &#xd;
{quote}RUN chown -R root:root /usr/local/lib/python*&#xd;
{quote}&#xd;
Fixed the Bitbucket pipeline build problem, but also increases the size of our Docker image because Docker makes a copy of all of the files that are modified (contents or filesystem flags). We will look again at multi-stage builds to reduce the size of our docker images.&#xd;

&#xd;
@Jason Harrison,&#xd;
&#xd;
to keep the size of final Docker image small, do NOT override anything related to the prior stages in the final one. For example, the following will lead to the increased size:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
FROM ... as stage_1&#xd;
...&#xd;
&#xd;
FROM ... as stage_2&#xd;
...&#xd;
&#xd;
FROM ... # final image&#xd;
&#xd;
...&#xd;
COPY --from=stage_2 /opt/tomcat /opt/&#xd;
RUN chown -R root:root /opt/tomcat&#xd;
...{code}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
a trick will be to copy properly and/or modify at an earlier stage:&#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
FROM ... as stage_1 &#xd;
... &#xd;
 &#xd;
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk-slim as stage_2 &#xd;
... &#xd;
# whatever is needed&#xd;
RUN chmod -R o-rwx "${CATALINA_HOME}" &amp;&amp; \&#xd;
    chmod 750 "${CATALINA_HOME}/logs" "${CATALINA_HOME}/temp" &amp;&amp; \&#xd;
    rm -rf "${JAVA_HOME}"/jmods \&#xd;

        "${CATALINA_HOME}"/webapps/*&#xd;
 &#xd;

One potential workaround in Pipelines is to use the Docker CLI which is automatically mounted in your build container for use in your script. In your case, the equivalent command would be something like:

{code:yaml}
script:
  - docker container create --name hello_2 hello-world

So we can prioritise this bug, can you explain a bit more about why you&amp;#x27;re using the Docker REST API rather than the CLI in your build process?
</text><author>Matt Ryall</author></comments><comments><text>This is a Java project with JUnit unit tests. Some of these are arguably integration tests. But they are designed such that they are self-contained in the sense that the test class does its own setup and teardown. This means its own database, its own mocked other-service dependencies. This is very beneficial for having tests that are independent and reproducible. A common strategy to do this is having an in-memory (Java) database, but unfortunately our application has hard-wired dependencies on PostgreSQL and some of its extensions. Therefore we&amp;#x27;re using a PostgreSQL Docker container for the database. This container gets spun up and down, before resp. after each individual test class. To do this, we&amp;#x27;re relying on the commonly-used [Spotify Docker Client|https://github.com/spotify/docker-client] (as part of our test setup), which works with the Docker API. In fact, I feel this is an appropriate use of the Docker API, and preferable over using the Docker CLI (as that would require calling the Docker CLI from Java, which isn&amp;#x27;t the most portable solution, or doing the setup before and after the entire test run using some other scripting, in which case we would be losing the granularity of a per-test database). With the Docker API we have a simpler requirement on the build environment, and the build becomes more portable. Except that it doesn&amp;#x27;t work in Bitbucket Pipelines. The same _does_ work in other environments (such as "locally"). The Spotify Docker Client is actually widely used for all sorts of similar things. And it&amp;#x27;s in fact only the "create container" command that isn&amp;#x27;t working.

Same problem with [bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin|https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin]. On a attempt to create container with "DockerCreateContainer" the error message from pipeline is {"message":"authorization denied by plugin pipelines: Command not supported."}.\\
Thank you.
</text><author>robertpancu</author></comments><comments><text>Thanks for the explanation, guys. We&amp;#x27;ll see what we can do to fix this.

In case it&amp;#x27;s useful, another (also non-portable) workaround is to use [service containers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-services-and-databases-in-bitbucket-pipelines-874786688.html] for starting your databases or other dependencies, then configure your code under test with an external database like you do in production. I realise you then can&amp;#x27;t use exactly the same code as running via Java locally, but it is probably the best option for running these tests in Pipelines until we can rectify this issue.

</text><author>4ntoine</author></comments><comments><text>Hi @4ntoine can you raise a ticket with atlassian support to investigate this, or alternatively provide me the logs of the docker daemon (you can get these from the docker tab on the step that has this error :)).

There is also a bug currently with docker and auth plugins as discussed here BCLOUD-15505 (its not just for the fabric8 maven plugin, almost all docker clients I&amp;#x27;ve encountered will have to provide a work around for the actual bug in docker as they dont usually provide back fixes for bugs :( and for clients to maintain backwards compatibility will have to work around it), not saying that may be the case here but worth noting :)
</text><author>lassian</author></comments><comments><text>Hi, Nathan.

I&amp;#x27;m able to run it locally (with the same cmd {{mvn clean install}}) so it looks like i don&amp;#x27;t have the bug and it can work.

I will attach full pipeline log file.\\
Let me know if it&amp;#x27;s enough or if you need anything else.
</text><author>4ntoine</author></comments><comments><text>Are you running our auth plugin locally too? If not we have an auth plugin that we apply to the the docker daemon in pipelines :)

The bug i linked to and mentioned above is in how docker and auth plugins interact when given certain types of content-type headers.

Ill dig into your logs but as, maybe the framework you use is trying to use a potential insecure feature of docker that we also disallow via said auth plugin.

This page has a list of the arguments/commands we specifically disallow in pipelines via our auth plugin.

import org.junit.ClassRule;

    @org.junit.Test
    public void test() {
        mySqlContainer.getDatabaseName();
    }
}

{code}

And it failed, I dug into why and it appears that the MySQLContainer in its configure method tried to mount in as the mysql configuration file "/etc/mysql/conf.d" the file taken from the value of the parameter TC_MY_CNF which by default is outside of your $BITBUCKET_CLONE_DIR.

In pipelines the only directory shared between the build container and the docker daemon is the clone directory and we thus we only allow/support mounting of files into containers from directories beneath it.

You can reconfigure this according to https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/database_containers.html#using-an-init-script, I havent used this library before but so I cant tell to what exactly :(
</text><author>lassian</author></comments><comments><text>@nburrell, thanks for quick investigation!

Test source code looks good.\\
I&amp;#x27;m still not sure what is "pipelines auth plugin". Can you explain so i will be able to reproduce it?

I&amp;#x27;m having similar tests and they run succesfully locally (but i did not attach any plugin intentionally except {{testcontainers}}), probably it makes sense.
</text><author>4ntoine</author></comments><comments><text>Sure, the auth plugin is a docker auth plugin as described here https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization. The custom one we run for pipelines simply filters all docker requests sent to the docker daemon and we disallow any potential malicious/exploitable docker arguments, as described here https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/run-docker-commands-in-bitbucket-pipelines-879254331.html.

Now the reason we run this plugin, is that the pipelines build infrastructure is multi tenanted as in customers builds run on the same hardware, so we run the plugin to protect our customers (amongst a whole range of other protections aswell ;))

Now the volume mount that is causing your pipeline to fail isnt malicious perse but due to the way the docker in daemon and build container interact we can only allow mounting of files beneath the directory at which we clone your repository, and the link above has how to configure test-containers to use a my-sql config script, you would I assume (ive never used this library so Im not 100% sure) have to change that property described in the link TC_MY_CNF to point to a file that is stored somwwhere beneath your clone directory this will than allow the mysql container to start.

Alternatively rather than using this framework you could also setup your step with a service container (which  has examples using mysql as described here https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-services-and-databases-in-bitbucket-pipelines-874786688.html). That would mean however your local testing would be configured differently to your testing in pipelines, however im confident that the setting described above (TC_MY_CNF) will allow you to use that framework in pipelines aswell :)

To test docker with our auth plugin locally (similarly described here https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/debug-your-pipelines-locally-with-docker-838273569.html) you can use the following image https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/pipelines-docker-daemon/  with the following docker command

{code}
#!bash

docker run --privileged --name docker -d -p 2375:2375 --memory=1g --memory-swap=1g --memory-swappiness=0  atlassian/pipelines-docker-daemon:prod-stable
{code}

And than reconfigure test containers to use localhost:2375 (as described here https://www.testcontainers.org/usage.html#docker-environment-discovery) as the docker daemon to run containers in rather than the docker daemon you have on your machine :) This docker daemon with the auth plugin configured the same as we do in pipelines, and with the same memory limits as pipelines (not that I think your hitting those but is also a thing thats different to your machine).
</text><author>lassian</author></comments><comments><text>Ran into this issue and whether the docker API accepts the connection depends on whether there is content-length in the headers.

I&amp;#x27;m using MySQL with testcontainers for testing and the build is running fine locally. Having to manually create the docker image is defeating the purpose of using the testcontainers because it&amp;#x27;s main feature is to create the image with no additional effort from the developers.
</text><author>twocachalotes</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Pavlin,

This is currently due to how test containers configures the init script for the mysql test container (they try to mount it from a directory we dont support in pipelines due to security reasons) as discussed here:

https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/700

To work around this you can either wait until the "bug" is fixed in test-containers or reconfigure where the my.cnf file is mounted from by following the instructions here:

https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/database_containers.html#overriding-mysql-mycnf-settings

It also works locally and not in pipelines as we execute steps on shared infrastructure and use a docker authorization plugin to secure docker.

Kind Regards,

Nathan Burrell

&#xd;
While I understand the purpose of the auth plugin to filter out malicious requests, is there any hopes, you can support Transfer-Encoding: chunked with unknown Content Length?</text><author>Omar Sood</author></comments><comments><text>Got the same issue.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Any ETA on a fix?</text><author>Søren Jepsen</author></comments><comments><text>Hello,&#xd;
&#xd;
Unfortunately we cant just add support for Transfer-Encoding: Chunked as the issue itself isnt with the transfer-encoding directly.&#xd;
&#xd;
We run an authorization plugin attached to every steps docker in docker daemon that inspects the payloads of all the requests to the docker daemon for potentially malicious arguments that would allow users to subvert the security of containers (such as --privileged containers) as we are running a multi tenanted environment we dont want users to be able to subvert this.&#xd;
&#xd;
How this plugins work is that when the docker daemon receives a request from a client (either the docker-cli, curl, some client in your favourite language etc) it first forwards that request (both the request line e.g. uri and query params and request body) to any authorization plugins which than perform inspections of them and return either an allow or deny (with an optional message) response. see for further information on authorization plugins: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_authorization/]&#xd;
&#xd;
Now unfortunately due to this line of code in the docker daemon [https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/authorization/authz.go#L58] &#xd;
{code:java}&#xd;
if sendBody(ctx.requestURI, r.Header) &amp;&amp; r.ContentLength > 0 &amp;&amp; r.ContentLength &lt; maxBodySize {&#xd;
{code}&#xd;
Request bodies are only forwarded to the docker daemon iff they are not for the /auth endpoint and are of content-type: application/json and have a content length that is > 0 and their content length is not > 1mb.&#xd;
&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Now unfortunately if your using transfer-encoding: chunked the content-length that most docker clients send through is 0 which is valid for that transfer encoding so that means the request body fails this request and the authorization plugin denies the request as we cant validate your request body doesnt contain any potentially malicious arguments.&#xd;
&#xd;
Well behaving clients may set the content-length but than there is still and issue in that the body isnt forwarded to the authorization plugin as the docker daemon doesnt first buffer in the request body so if we were to read it it would drain the request body and than the docker daemon would fail the request as it couldnt read the body of the drained stream.&#xd;
&#xd;
Really docker should improve as this affects not just pipelines but anyone using authorization plugins we are lucky enough to know of this and this can be exploited in other auth plugins who dont perform these extra validations of content-length.&#xd;
&#xd;
So for now this is the reason why we cant support transfer-encoding: chunked.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
Ill link this to the docker-java ticket as that is the client we see this request on the most and also test containers.&#xd;

&#xd;
-Do you know how this works with the PUT container endpoint? Because they are definitely larger than 1mb in many cases and don't state the content length in the example in the docs?- &#xd;
&#xd;
-I'm asking because this is also an [issue when using the spring-boot-plugin|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/22840] to build docker containers from a spring-boot application, but the team was open to update the POST request to create the container, if they would know that the subsequent PUT wouldn't run into the same issue.-&#xd;

Thanks for the suggestion.

Currently we do not send email notifications for scheduled pipelines. I&amp;#x27;ll open this issue so we can keep track of this request and also to gauge the interest of other users on this functionality. However, the team are currently working on higher priority features so it is unlikely that we&amp;#x27;ll be working on this anytime soon.

</text><author>Aneita</author></comments><comments><text>This really should&amp;#x27;ve been part of the MVP. How else am I supposed to know what&amp;#x27;s going on with my pipelines? The Slack notifications are not granular enough (and far from everyone uses Slack).
</text><author>TheRealJimbo</author></comments><comments><text>I agree that this is part of basic functionality for scheduled pipelines. We use them for static analysis tools, and we need to know when they fail. What do you propose as an alternative?

Moreover, it&amp;#x27;s very unclear that I will not get notified for scheduled pipelines. I&amp;#x27;m watching the repository and subscribed to "all pipelines". I didn&amp;#x27;t realize that my scheduled pipeline was failing and I just wasn&amp;#x27;t getting notified until I happened to go to the pipelines page for a different issue.
</text><author>Robert Li</author></comments><comments><text>Same for us here... our scheduled builds where failing since 1 month and didn&amp;#x27;t get notified at all. This should really be part of the MVP...

Since the scheduled pipelines takes the same "revision comment" than the latest commit build, I was expecting that the user that did the latest commit was at least getting notified but it it not the case...

Big issue here, top priority for us. Thanks for listening to your paying subscribers...

I have changed the type of this feature request ticket to bug as Bitbucket pipelines fail to trigger email notification when scheduled pipelines fails. The feature becomes important for the scheduled builds running in non-working hours and fails and the teams are unaware of it.&#xd;

As a result, a build could fail because a service container was not fully started yet (e.g. a test failed because a database service container had not fully started).&#xd;
&#xd;
Maybe this should be an optional configurable setting in the YML? This might require user input to define when a service container is considered to be 'ready'.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Edit:* this wait is already implemented for Docker and auth proxy services. &#xd;

In the meantime you can do this yourselves by adding an initial step to your pipeline that waits for the service to be ready, e.g. poll for 200 OK, before allowing the remaining steps to run.</description><createDate>2017-11-19T23:57:24.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Thanks for the suggestion.

If you create the repo through the API without any branches, the first branch that you git push to the repo automatically becomes the main branch.

&#xd;
To solve this issue for my team, in my ps-script I create a repo, clone it, create my dev-branch and delete the (default) master-branch so that my dev-branch is now the main branch. Normally I would have the release-branch on top and the dev-branch down to it and down to the dev-branch the feature-branches, but for this workaround I need to have the dev-branch on top and the release-branch and feature-branches down to the dev-branch. The release-branch and feature-branches are at the same level.&#xd;

</text><author>dinamic</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Everyone,\\
We appreciate your passion, and understand the sensitivity around this issue.  Unfortunately, we do not have a specific eta on when this issue will be solved.  In the meantime, you can use the following workaround to have your information removed from the account:

# Contact our Customer Advocates team using the form at https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact/purchasing-licensing.
# Please make sure to add the following information in your inquiry:

* Bitbucket account URL.
* Request the credit card information on file for the account be removed.
* Make sure the email you enter in the form matches the primary email of the account in Bitbucket Cloud.
* If the account is a Team, please make sure the email you enter in the form belongs to an Admin of the team.

Please note, that the account/team in question will have to currently be on the free plan for the current billing period, and have no outstanding charges.  If the account/team in question is on the free plan with overages for Pipelines, or LFS, then we will not be able to remove the card information until the current billing period ends.

Once our Customer Advocate team process this request, it will take up to a week before the information disappears in Bitbucket Cloud.  You can also feel free to reach out to the support team at https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/ with any questions.  Feel free to mention my name specifically in your support request, and I will make sure to personally review.

Thank you,

Gary

</text><author>Steve Muskiewicz</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Steve,

I am personally trying to reconcile the statuses of issues on our internal tracker with this issue tracker, on the order of slightly more than 14,000 issues, with the goal of narrowing down the list of open issues to ones that actually need attention.  You are correct that I did not verify whether this was actually fixed or not, but I did verify that a pull request was merged and deployed which purported to fix this issue in July of 2014.  Hopefully you can forgive me for not verifying each of the 14,000 issues individually.  I&amp;#x27;m happy to reopen this and the corresponding internal issue.

Cheers,\\

</text><author>Zachary Davis</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Zach,

I apologize if my response seemed personally directed at you (it was not) but I hope you will also appreciate my source of frustration here.  As you are no doubt well aware, this is one of (too) *many* Bitbucket issues that have remained in an unresolved state for multiple years now, with no comment or acknowledgment from Atlassian, despite multiple user votes, "+1"&amp;#x27;s and requests for status updates.  And to me this particular issue is more egregious in that it was (apparently) fixed but then just as quickly reverted with a terse explanation and no follow up despite the comment to the contrary.

So while I am certainly happy to see that some of these issues are getting some long overdue attention and definitely sympathetic to you as the unlucky dude who is tasked with plowing through this mess, I can&amp;#x27;t help but think that if Atlassian/Bitbucket had not proceeded to ignore them for such a long period of time that they would not be in this position now.

Thank you in advance for all your efforts and I would definitely appreciate it if you could reopen this issue so that hopefully someone can give it another look in the near future.

regards,\\

</text><author>Steve Muskiewicz</author></comments><comments><text>Happy belated second birthday to this issue...
</text><author>Bryan</author></comments><comments><text>As you can see, I&amp;#x27;ve attempted a fix for this before, however it broke a number of APIs (Everything at https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Busername%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/commit aside from the basic one) so it had to be reverted.

The way our APIs are structured, it will not be possible to add support to this endpoint for branch names until we release a new major revision because for v2, it will either shadow APIs or some branches won&amp;#x27;t be accessible.

However, there is a workaround which just involves one additional request to grab the commit hash then using that in any of the endpoints. https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Busername%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/refs/branches/%7Bname%7D should work with branch names which contain slashes.

I&amp;#x27;m leaving this open, but dropping the priority because our hands are tied and there is an existing workaround.

This bug was opened more than 6 (SIX) years ago and nothing was fixed. This is embarrassing!</text><author>Holger Becker</author></comments><comments><text>Hello all,&#xd;
&#xd;
Sorry that this has been such a long-standing bug. I don't blame anyone for getting upset!&#xd;
&#xd;
I've been looking into this bug and want to point out a couple of things.&#xd;
 # Branch names with '/' *should work* with any API or path where the branch name/revision is the *last part* of the path. This includes, but is not limited to, the following APIs. So the API specifically mentioned on this issue is working today. I'm not sure when (I can look that up) and I'm sorry that this issue was never updated. If you find an API where this is not the case, it can be easily fixed, relatively speaking :)&#xd;
 ## /2.0/repositories/\{workspace}/\{repo}/commits/\{revision}&#xd;
 ## /2.0/repositories/\{workspace}/\{repo}/refs/\{branch_name}&#xd;
 # Branch names with a '/' *will not* work with any API where the revisions is *not the last part* of the path. src being probably the most notable&#xd;
 ## /2.0/repositories/\{workspace}/\{repo}/src/\{revision}/\{path}&#xd;
&#xd;
It's not to say that there isn't any solution, but any solution comes with trade offs and they're not all that great. Here are some solutions that have been brainstormed.&#xd;
 * escape branch names. URL escaping cannot work and the %2F will be re-written before even reaching the app as this is part of the WSGI spec. We'd need to pick a custom character (that is a character that is an illegal branch name character). `\` could work, but I've read that these can be treated as '/' on windows. If we chose to use an escaping solution it will be non-standard and unintuitive and I'm unsure how many people would know about it.&#xd;
 * New APIs. This is the most straight forward fix but also the most change and it could be inconsistent with our other URLs. Revisions can just become query params and the problem is solved.&#xd;
 * Branch lookups - this is possible but could entail a performance hit as we now have to keep track what all the current valid branch names are. Furthermore, this solution is even more difficult with the /src/ API because now we have 2 path arguments that both can contain a slash! We'd have to not only search for possible branch names, we'd have to search within files too. And we still wouldn't be able to eliminate all ambiguity.&#xd;
 * Some sort of a query parameter replacement. Replace the revision segment of the path with '\{branch}' and add a query parameter ?branch= and we will substitute that query parameter into the branch name.&#xd;
&#xd;
I hope you can see that none of the solutions are really that optimal. Please advise on which of these solutions makes sense to you.</text><author>seanaty</author></comments><comments><text>Has there been any progress with this (src)? I'm running into this and it's a real pain. The only potential solution I came up with is to do a request ahead of time to get the commit hash and use that instead of the branch name that contains a slash.</text><author>Ben Verwey</author></comments><comments><text>*Does not work for*&#xd;

Now I&amp;#x27;ve decided that I want to group my feature branches not with a &amp;#x27;dev/&amp;#x27; prefix but with &amp;#x27;feature/&amp;#x27;, and I want to use a branch called &amp;#x27;dev&amp;#x27; as the integration branch with all finished changes.

So I merged and deleted all &amp;#x27;dev/*&amp;#x27; branches on Bitbucket and locally. I then created a local &amp;#x27;dev&amp;#x27; branch (branching off of the &amp;#x27;master&amp;#x27; branch). Now if I try to push this branch to Bitbucket (remote &amp;#x27;origin&amp;#x27;), I get the following error:

{code}
#!bash

 ! [remote rejected] dev -> dev (failed to write)
error: failed to push some refs to &amp;#x27;https://mjpvandenberg@bitbucket.org/xxx/xxx.git&amp;#x27;

{code}

My guess is that, although all &amp;#x27;dev/*&amp;#x27; branches have been deleted, there&amp;#x27;s still a &amp;#x27;dev&amp;#x27; folder in .git/refs/heads.  I am not aware of any method by which to actively remove this folder, either thru the web interface or with any git-remote command. I don&amp;#x27;t know how often git-gc runs on Bitbucket and if it will fix this issue. If I use the web interface to create a new branch off of &amp;#x27;master&amp;#x27; directly in the Bitbucket repo, the error message says &amp;#x27;Invalid branch name&amp;#x27;.

It would be nice if Bitbucket could see that the &amp;#x27;dev&amp;#x27; branch name is in fact available.</description><createDate>2014-04-11T18:25:30.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi

For what repository do you want us to check this on? Maybe you can email support@bitbucket.org with the details if you don&amp;#x27;t want to say here.

* Switch to git ssh clone. Set up ssh key too.\\
git clone git@bitbucket.org:company/gitrepo.git
* Recreate new branch with same name from ssh cloned repo, ghostbranch in this example.\\
git push origin master:ghostbranch
* Delete branch again from ssh cloned repo.\\
git push origin :ghostbranch
* Now you can create a new branch that uses name as prefix\\
git push origin master:ghostbranch/test

In the end https server is a wrapper of real git developed by bitbucket. It might have a bug not cleaning up file in .git/logs/refs/heads/ghostbranch. Ssh git does this correctly.

</text><author>belak</author></comments><comments><text>This is copied from another bug:

When you select &amp;#x27;close branch after the pull request is merged&amp;#x27; and the merge the pull request the reflog is not being cleaned up. This means that any future branches with that name as path prefix cannot be successfully pushed to due to a git error.

Steps to reproduce:

# Create a branch from master called "foo"
# Create a commit on foo and push it to Bitbucket
# Create a PR from foo to master, selecting close branch after merge
# Merge the PR
# Create a branch locally called "foo/my-new-branch-name"
# Attempt to push a commit to "foo/my-new-branch-name" on bitbucket

You will see an error from git that looks something like\\
{{error: unable to create directory for ./logs/refs/heads/foo/my-new-branch-name}}

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When running a Cleanup Task as part of a Job, Bamboo will report a {{NoSuchFileException}} in case one of the to-be-deleted files or folders is not available during the task execution – E.g. it was deleted by an external process during the Task execution – even if the resulting build directory ends up cleaned up.&#xd;
&#xd;
The issue also happens when a symlink on Windows is to be deleted, but Bamboo deletes its target location before the actual symlink. This is an expected behaviour on Windows and Bamboo should be able to gracefully accept the error.&#xd;

Data import can fail for instances with a large dataset.&#xd;
&#xd;
Customer is moving from MySql to postgres. So, they did a data export. &#xd;
Then, they setup a new Bamboo instance on a new server and imported zip file as part of starting Bamboo for the first time. Import fails&#xd;
&#xd;
*Expected Results*&#xd;
Import completes without errors&#xd;
&#xd;
*Actual Results*&#xd;
High level of Bamboo's import process&#xd;
 # Users, projects, plans, build results are imported as expected. &#xd;
 # The "AO" tables are processed&#xd;
 ## The import process starts reading the &lt;export>/db-export/activeObjects.xml file&#xd;
 ## In the database, 40+ tables are created to hold this information&#xd;
 ## The import process starts to load these tables.&#xd;
 ## At some point in the import process, the Support plugin (I believe) thinks it is OK to run in the background. This adds data to some of these AO_* tables.&#xd;
 ## Before the import process can load the AO_4789DD_PROPERTIES, the plugin has already updated the table. This causes the Unique Constraint error we are seeing.&#xd;
 ## The only information in the AO_4789DD_PROPERTIES table is the last time the plugin ran. &#xd;
 ## So, this come down to a timing issue. The export is so large, the plugin fires before the data loading is complete and causes the problem. &#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When multiple linked repositories with Bamboo specs enabled are connected to the same version control system (VCS) repository—with specs configured for several Bamboo plans—plan creation and updates for the main branch using specs work smoothly. &#xd;
&#xd;
For plan branches, the first execution of the specs and the conversion to the "specs branch" are successful for all plans. However, after the initial update, the specs for one or more plan branches may not get updated. Additionally, a manual specs scan from the Bamboo UI can fail, resulting in the following error:&#xd;

&#xd;
&#xd;
This is reproducible on Data Center: (/)&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create two linked repositories named "repo1" and "repo2" using the same VCS, with JAVA/YAML Bamboo specs for two plans: "PlanA" and "PlanB" in the same repository.&#xd;
# Enable "Bamboo specs" for both linked repositories.&#xd;
# Publish and create 2 plans in Bamboo through these linked repos.&#xd;
# Both plans "PlanA" and "PlanB" were created successfully, specs configuration was updated to the "default" branch.&#xd;
# Create a branch in the VCS repo having specs code now.&#xd;
# Plan branches will be created in both plans "PlanA" and "PlanB" and converted to "Specs branches" successfully with branch specs configuration.&#xd;

#*  !Screenshot 2025-01-10 at 4.40.15 PM.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
# Then, update the specs configuration for the plans in the branch code configuration in VCS repo.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
Branch specs configuration should be updated to all plan branches if there are any updated configurations in the specs code.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
Only one branch under the plan has updated specs, while the other does not, as shown below:&#xd;

There is no entry for all plan branches in the "vcs_specs_state" table with branch code commit. As a result, the manual specs scan for the plan branch from the UI under Bamboo Overview > Linked Repositories > Specs Scan also fails.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
Maintain different VCS repositories for specs repositories for different plans in Bamboo and create linked repositories for those in Bamboo. We have seen a few issues in Bamboo before also if multiple linked repositories with specs enabled are created in Bamboo with the same VCS repository.</description><createDate>2025-01-13T07:54:20.000+0000</createDate><comments/></item><item><summary>Deleting a deployment leads to orphaned artifacts.</summary><key>BAM-21563</key><url>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-21563</url><type>Bug</type><priority></priority><description>h3. Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Deleting a deployment project/environment that is consuming an artifact from globalStorage will leave the artifact orphaned on the disk and will be never deleted by the expiry.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Create build plan B that shares an artifact.&#xd;
 # Create a deployment project DP that consumes the artifact of B and deploy the first build result to a stage in DP.&#xd;
 # Build B 4 times and trigger the expiry ( assuming that the expiry will keep last 3 build results and 2 deployments. This will move the first artifact of B to the globalStorage/artifactID).&#xd;
 # Delete DP&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The artifact in globalStorage/artifactID is deleted when the deployment is deleted or during expiry.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The artifact in globalStorage/artifactID is never deleted.&#xd;

The Automation Platform has intentionally made this decision, as explained in this document: [How-to: Customer wants their rules to count towards a different product billing home|https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AUTODEV/pages/3240599330/How-to+Customer+wants+their+rules+to+count+towards+a+different+product+billing+home].&#xd;
{quote}A note on SPORK:  Despite JWM and JSW combining into a single product “Jira”,  JWM projects aka Business projects still follow the above table and are billed to the product with the highest usage limit.{quote}&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
As a result, any rules that are specific to a single JWM project (Business project) should be billed to the product with the highest usage limit, rather than to Jira. There are no plans to change this at the moment.&#xd;

 * Automation rule not respecting the custom field date/ time value although converts the time to UTC which is the JIRA default time when a smart value is included. The Summary should be updated with the same time in the {color:#de350b}'mediumDateTime'{color} format, but Jira converts the time in the custom field to its default time which is UTC and updates the Summary section. Found this [link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/automation073/working-with-dates-1093013348.html] and it looks like for all smart values the time is being converted into Jira's default timezone. *Steps to Reproduce*&#xd;
 ** Create a custom field with date/time picker and add this field to a 'Create Issue' screen on a service project.&#xd;
 ** Create an automation: When an issue is created with a particular verbiage in Summary section, trigger the automation to update the 'Summary' section as following: "issue.ExactDateTime.{color:#de350b}mediumDateTime{color}". --/ ExactDateTime is the DateTime custom field&#xd;
 * The smart value {{Now}} returns the current date and time in UTC+00:00, as documented here: [https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-smart-values-date-and-time/#Current-date-and-time---now--]  This is not, however, clearly flagged in the automation rule UI, which leads users to assume that the value will match their own timezone. Given the way this value functions, it would be best not to refer to it in the UI without further info. Workaround: You can set your timezone of choice [https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-smart-values-date-and-time/#Convert-timezone-date---]&#xd;
 * Once automation is triggered and the audit log records this run, timestamps are saved according to the browser timezone and ignore any configuration made in the instance default timezone or user AA account timezone preferences.  Expected result is that Timestamps being updated according to the AA preferences and match the timestamp in the issue history, but actual result is that Automation rule audit log timestamps stay the same no matter the configuration change regarding the timezone preferences. Changing the Instance timezone from jira/settings/system/general-configuration also results in the same behavior&#xd;
 * If a user sets any timezone in personal settings, it is not reflected when using the smart values: {{reporter.timezone}} or {{assignee.timezone}} And instead the system default is used. This occurs even when using the correct cannonical ID found on this [page. |https://joda-time.sourceforge.net/timezones.html]You will see both assignee and reporter timezones being listed as the system default, while the initiator reflects the timezone you've set in your personal settings. All three should be matching if all three are the same user (which they should be since you are the initiator, assignee, and reporter).Additionally, some timezones such as "America/Moncton" don't even get recognized despite being a correct timezone ID found in the page linked above (which is referenced in our automation documentation). Jira instead just falls back to the _last_ used timezone instead of the currently set one (you can test this by doing the same above first chaning your timezone to "America/Chicago", waiting a few minutes, then changing it to "America/Moncton". You will see that "America/Chicago" is still being used for initiator.timezone).</description><createDate>2022-06-30T23:09:01.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Why Automation would not respect our Jira instance timezone...&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When a user is a member of too many groups (for example 900+), the Confluence searches will show an error "{_}We're having trouble getting your results{_}" instead of the content matching the criteria.&#xd;
&#xd;
These many group memberships usually result from provisioning all internal groups to Atlassian, instead of only groups used for Product Access and content permissions.&#xd;
&#xd;
The exact number of groups that result in search failures is still not clear, but it was reproducible intermittently between 700-850 group memberships and consistently with 900 group memberships or more. The behavior seems to be affected by factors like filter used in the search (for example, "include archived content", "type" or "author") and also by the content of each instance.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Assign 900+ groups to a user&#xd;
 # Login as that user and try to perform a search in Confluence&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Search displays results matching the search criteria&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
Error message displayed:&#xd;
&#xd;
"{_}We're having trouble getting your results{_}"&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
The current workaround consists of reducing the amount of group memberships the user belongs to. That can be achieved by either removing the user from unnecessary groups or filtering out some of the groups provisioned to Atlassian (removing groups used internal or for other applications).&#xd;
&#xd;
Based on some testing, the safest approach for now is to keep the max memberships for a single user under 700 groups to completely avoid the bug.</description><createDate>2024-11-28T22:04:18.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>This ticket has been marked as 'long term backlog' because it's currently in the planning phase with our principal engineers.

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
We've seen 2 instances where users have migrated via CCMA and content is not indexed properly resulting in inaccurate search results or Page Properties Report macro failing to pull accurate data.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Migrate Space data via CCMA&#xd;
 # First Path - Search for data that would typically return many results&#xd;
 # Second Path - View a page with Page Properties Report macro&#xd;
(NOTE: There are additional variables that are not accounted for yet as there have been migrations where Support triggering reindexing is not required.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
 * When trying both paths, results should be accurate and match results from Confluence Server&#xd;
 * It would be helpful to have visibility into the state of indexing. This would help users know they were impacted instead of running into a variety of symptoms&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
In both cases, the results are not valid. The Page Properties Report macro will show only 1 page instead of many. Search by keyword or another filter will not pull the correct number of pages.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 * For Searches - Manual workaround is to edit a page to see it populate in Search&#xd;
 * For Page Properties Macro - Manual workaround is to perform any type of edit on the page so the macro can locate missing page&#xd;

When you perform searches in Confluence using AI, entered in a language other than English, and your [account language preferences|https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences] are set to the same language, the AI will provide parts of its response in English instead of entirely in the language you have chosen.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Around 4/1/2025, deactivating a managed, synced via SCIM started showing the following message on the managed account profile page: "This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services. Their account was deactivated by Atlassian."&#xd;
&#xd;
Before this date, only the following message was shown: "This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services."&#xd;
&#xd;
While neither is particularly helpful, the new message implies that Atlassian did something to deactivate this user, rather than this being an issue with the identity provider requesting that Atlassian deactivate the user.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
1. On a SCIM synced managed account, SCIM sync a deactivation&#xd;
2. Navigate to the managed account's profile (https://admin.atlassian.com/o/&lt;orgid>/members/&lt;aaid>)&#xd;
3. Observe "Their account was deactivated by Atlassian." addition to the typical message. (If this does not occur, refresh the page a few times and it will appear.) &#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
The original error message is shown: "This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services."&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
The new error message is shown: "This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services. Their account was deactivated by Atlassian."&#xd;
&#xd;
Suggested Solution&#xd;
---&#xd;
&#xd;
Ideal solution is to provide a more helpful error message, like "This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services. Your identity provider synced an update that requested Atlassian deactivate this account."&#xd;
&#xd;
Otherwise, reverting back to the original message ("This account is deactivated. &lt;email> no longer has access to Atlassian account services.") would help customers understand that Atlassian did not trigger this action, but merely followed through with a request from the identity provider.&#xd;
&#xd;
Why this is important&#xd;
---&#xd;
Customers need to understand why their managed accounts are unable to access any Atlassian Cloud service so they can resolve issues quickly. Without informative error messages, customers are left with no clear resolution path and must contact our support team to learn more, slowing down critical operations.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
&#xd;
Make sure that the user is active in your identity provider and assigned to the Atlassian Cloud App (or otherwise ensure your identity provider is syncing to Atlassian).&#xd;
&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
As stated in the [What activities does the audit log include?|https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/] article, the Organization Audit Log includes several information, including changes to space permissions for Confluence. &#xd;
{quote} * Changes to space permissions for Confluence{quote}&#xd;
However, when using the "Add people to all spaces" feature to bulk edit (add or remove) space permissions, the action is not being registered in the Organization Audit Log.&#xd;
&#xd;
Consequently, at the time of writing, only space permissions modifications made individual or manually are being displayed in the Organization Audit Log, but not the bulk space permissions modification. This lack of logging prevents administrators from tracking changes in space permissions directly in the Organization Audit Log, which is crucial for maintaining audit trails and ensuring security compliance. &#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Navigate to the Space Permissions management section in Confluence Cloud ([https://site-name.atlassian.net/wiki/admin/permissions/space-permissions/allspaces]).&#xd;
 # Use the "Add people to all spaces" feature to grant permissions to a user or group.&#xd;
 # After that, navigate to the Organization Audit Log (from your Org > Security > Audit Log).&#xd;
 # Search for any entries related to the action performed in step 2.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
If the admin goes to Confluence Cloud Audit Log, there will be record for this action (for example: User added to all spaces, excluding personal spaces).&#xd;
&#xd;
Since this is a logged action, it should be registered and displayed in the Organization Audit Log too. &#xd;

&#xd;
This bulk action is not being displayed in the Organization Audit Log. It is only available in Confluence Cloud Audit Log. &#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
External users who have JSM access only (no other product access) will not show up when:&#xd;
* Exporting external users from any policy.&#xd;
* Trying to add that external user to a test policy.&#xd;
* Viewing your total external user count.&#xd;
&#xd;
The security settings of external users is still applied, meaning that these external users will still be asked to enter a one-time passcode, etc.&#xd;
&#xd;
This prevents admins primarily from knowing the true set of external users and from applying test policies to those users.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
# Invite an unmanaged user with access to your site, but only grant JSM customer access. For clarity, ensure that this user does not have MFA enabled for their Atlassian account.&#xd;
# Turn on External User Security settings.&#xd;
# Have the unmanaged user navigate to https://aproducticanvortex.atlassian.net and confirm that they are asked for a one time passcode.&#xd;
# Navigate to your External User Security settings and confirm that:&#xd;
## Exporting users does not include this user.&#xd;
## You are not able to add this user to a test external user security policy.&#xd;
## Your external user security user count does not include this user.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
External Atlassian accounts with only JSM customer access should be exportable, included in the total external user count, and addeable to a test external user security policy.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
# Exporting users does not include this user.&#xd;
# You are not able to add this user to a test external user security policy.&#xd;
# Your external user security user count does not include this user.&#xd;

Because if Customers are provisioned by an IdP, they will have an Atlassian account and won't be considered as ‘Portal-only customers’.&#xd;
And by not appearing in ‘External users’ (their domain cannot be verified because their company is different than the organization), they won't have any authentication policy assigned to them.</text><author>Florent Baret</author></comments><comments><text>Hello [~66c2a9d5cc86] , &#xd;
&#xd;
it would be great if you could fix this soon and implement the same functionality as in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-1362 (and [https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Articles/Collaborate-more-securely-by-enforcing-single-sign-on-for/ba-p/2813301)] for licenced external users also for Service Desk Customers.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have a lot of Atlassian Account users as  Service Desk Customers that we want to "migrate" to IdP, but currently I have no possibility to enforce any policy for them.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
When we have Confluence Cloud subscription with a JIRA Software Free one, in case the landing product is set to Confluence and the JIRA site is suspended, the landing product won't work as it is expected.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Make sure you have a Confluence Cloud standard and JIRA Software Free subscriptions;&#xd;
 # Navigate to *Site Administration > Product Access* and [set Confluence as the landing product|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/set-your-sites-landing-product/];&#xd;
 # Get the JIRA subscription suspended&#xd;
 # Acces your site URL without {{.../wiki}}&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
You are redirected to Confluence.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
You land in JIRA - as it is suspended, you face a site deactivated message.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # The customer can wait for the suspended product to be deleted&#xd;
 # From the billing console, the product can be deleted immediately&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
&#xd;
Media API links for attachments within products are accessible by external users who are not authenticated on the site and are not part of the IP addresses added to the IP allowlist.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
&#xd;
In Confluence with IP allowlist enabled for example&#xd;
 # Create a page&#xd;
# Add some images/screenshots&#xd;
# Open the image from the attachment section or try to download the images&#xd;
# It will generate a request to the Media platform: {{[https://api.media.atlassian.com/file/XXXXXXXXX/binary?client=XXXXXXXXX&amp;token=XXXXXXXX&amp;name=FILE-NAME.png]}}&#xd;
# Copy the link of the request from the browser Network Tab&#xd;

The "Last Active" date may not consistently align with the actual last instance a user was active in a specific application, such as Jira or Confluence.&#xd;
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
This inconsistency in the "Last Active" date can be more accurately identified by customers who possess Enterprise licensed applications. They have access to application events in the Audit log, allowing them to observe if a user has viewed a Jira issue, made edits, or interacted with a different section of the application.&#xd;
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! &#xd;
&#xd;
(+) The inconsistencies in the 'Last Active' dates are not confined to mere hours. They can, in fact, be inaccurate for an extended period, even beyond weeks.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Environment&#xd;
(!) Cloud, New centric User Management experience.&#xd;
Create an environment comprised of:&#xd;
# Jira Work Management&#xd;
# Jira Service Management&#xd;
# Jira Software&#xd;
&#xd;
Grant some of your users access to either JWM, Software, or JSM&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
Can be more easily reproduced using the following constraints:&#xd;
|*User A*|JWM access only|&#xd;
&#xd;
# User A logs into JWM and creates a ticket.&#xd;
## This action gets logged and "Last Active" updates.&#xd;
# User A logs after a couple days back in Jira to view a JSW Jira ticket.&#xd;
## User A has the permissions to view the ticket.&#xd;
# User A open the ticket and view it for more than 2 seconds&#xd;
## This activity gets recorded in the *Audit Log* of Atlassian Access for *Enterprise licenses*&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
*Last Active* date should be updated to show the last activity of the user in Jira, which was when the user browsed the JSW project Jira ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
*Last Active* date is not updated with the last time the user viewed the JSW Jira ticket.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
There is no workaround besides having the users _create tickets_ or _perform other actions in different Jira project types_.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Additional notes&#xd;
This bug also affects the retrieval of these values through the API, which directly impacts the ability of certain customers to automate their user lifecycles.</description><createDate>2024-03-01T14:26:01.000+0000</createDate><comments><comments><text>Hi Team, can you please help to prioritize this defect as we are planning to use this field for managing the user license management based on the last active date using users admin API</text><author>Jyothish Pillai</author></comments><comments><text>Hi Team, I am running into this issue also, and created a service request and added some logging data of specific users that got reset in a recent, small timeframe.  Please check JST-994452 for details.  If you want a look at the data itself, i can reopen and grant that access.</text><author>Dirk Vanhaute</author></comments><comments><text>With no workaround available, we would greatly appreciate this bug being prioritized for development.&#xd;

&#xd;
We are actively working on improving the way we show 'Last active' dates in Admin Hub (admin.atlassian.com).&#xd;
&#xd;
Our investigations found there is *no inaccuracy* with the data source of the ‘Last active’ dates on the Users page or in Audit logs.&#xd;
&#xd;
*However, as ‘Last active’ on the Users page vs ‘Last active’ in Audit logs are driven by different data sources, they have different definitions based on their events.*&#xd;
&#xd;
*Definition of ‘Last active' for the Users page from:* [User's last active dates|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/user-last-active-dates/]&#xd;
 * Returns user’s last active date for each product listed in Atlassian Administration.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Active is defined as viewing a product's page for a minimum of 2 seconds.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * The data for the last activity may be delayed by up to 24 hours.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * If the user has not accessed a product, the product_access response field will be empty.&#xd;
&#xd;
*Activity events captured by audit log:* [Track organization activities from the audit log|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/]&#xd;
&#xd;
So while both the ‘Last active’ date on the Users page and in Audit logs are accurate based on their individual definitions and data sources, I acknowledge the inconsistency between these pages and the confusion it may cause.&#xd;
&#xd;
Our engineering team is working on a long-term solution to reconcile the data sources between these pages. In the interim, we have updated our [public-facing documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/user-last-active-dates/] to clarify the differences in definitions.&#xd;
&#xd;
Thanks a lot for your feedback, I really appreciate your patience while we make these improvements.&#xd;

Groups synced via SCIM in a siteless organization are not available in the Admin Hub UI and can't be used to assign product access for siteless products.

When viewing a user in User Management the UI message "This account is deactivated &lt;name> no longer has access to Atlassian account services. Their account was deactivated by Atlassian" sometimes shows on users who were *not* deactivated by Atlassian.&#xd;

&#xd;
Thanks for your patience on this ticket so far. I just wanted to provide a quick update on some of the planned changes to improve the performance of SCIM provisioning:&#xd;
 * Short term (FY24Q4): an opt-in experience for customers with 500k+ writes (sum of users, groups, and memberships), with expected provisioning time improvements of up to 50%. This short term solution will be opt-in as it involves changes to some admin experiences.&#xd;
&#xd;
 * Longer term (FY25H2): we are currently working on architectural changes that are expected to reduce provisioning time to 20% of what it is today. These changes will be available to all customers.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the meantime, if you’re expecting to sync a large number of groups (e.g. 10k+) via your IdP, I’d recommend starting your sync a week ahead to avoid any issues with delays in syncing. I acknowledge this is a suboptimal experience at the moment. We’re doing our best to make things better as soon as possible.&#xd;
&#xd;
I hope this information is helpful. If you have any questions about anything, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via this ticket.&#xd;

Issue Summary&#xd;
Deleting a user from Identity Providers does not deactivate the user in the Atlassian directory and the SCIM data is orphaned for the user.&#xd;
h3. Steps to Reproduce&#xd;
 # Sync a user from your IdP to the Atlassian directory via user provisioning.&#xd;
 # Delete the user directly in your IdP directory and not from the Atlassian Cloud application.&#xd;
 # This will remove the user assignment from the application and the IdP directory&#xd;
 # The next provisioning does not deactivate the account at Atlassian Cloud; The user stays active in Atlassian and the SCIM data is orphaned.&#xd;
&#xd;
h3. Expected Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The user should get deactivated over the next provisioning cycle.&#xd;
h3. Actual Results&#xd;
&#xd;
The IdP never sends further updates about the user to Atlassian Cloud, causing a desync. The Atlassian Accounts get locked in an orphaned state since the user still belongs to the provisioning scope and their Atlassian Account does not deactivate.&#xd;
h3. Workaround&#xd;
 # Recreate the user on your IdP, add the user to the provisioning scope, and wait for it to be provisioned. Deactivate the account at the IdP and wait for this to be synced. Then delete the account from the IdP&#xd;

4. The User 'usernamehere' is disabled in Azure Active Directory, but active in AtlassianCloud. They will be disabled in AtlassianCloud.&#xd;
5. Skipped.  The state of the entry in both the source and target systems already match. No change to the User 'usernamehere' currently needs to be made.&#xd;
 &#xd;
&#xd;
Result - The Atlassian user remains enabled even though the AzureAD user has been removed from scope.&#xd;

 </text><author>Alistair Stewart</author></comments><comments><text>We also experience the same issue, once a user is deleted from Azure Active Directory it stays in the Atlassian Cloud as Managed Account. It is not possible to deactivate it (managed by the identity provider). Furthermore, the account gets email changed to [accountId][previous email] e.g. "6c129ae00dda4435a99b1cb416823c1ffirstname.lastname@domain.com".&#xd;
&#xd;
Restarting the provisioning didn't seem to solve the issue.&#xd;

User counts toward license use, which is unacceptable!</text><author>Vid Kraner</author></comments><comments><text>The work-around provided here is not working.&#xd;
We have synced an Azure AD group with Atlassian via Provisioning. So technically when we remove a user from the Azure AD group, on the next provisioning cycle, the user should not stay active and as 'Managed Account' in Atlassian. It either needs to be deleted or deactivated. Can't even edit the user details, as it says "Managed by the identity provider". &#xd;

Is there a fix for it?</text><author>ruhi.rezaie</author></comments><comments><text>[~ruhi.rezaie] Nicely described, this is exactly our problem.&#xd;

But this issue is Unassigned, hopefully it reaches someone.</text><author>Vid Kraner</author></comments><comments><text>yeah, it`s a little bit annoying....</text><author>Florian Reichl</author></comments><comments><text>This issue also describes the problem we have&#xd;
Someone please work on this please!</text><author>Tobias Nöth</author></comments><comments><text>I would like to point out that the " *Symptom Severity"* may not be correctly classified.&#xd;
&#xd;
De-provisioning plays one of the most vital roles in an Enterprise org. The whole purpose of having SCIM is the convenience of making changes at one central point and not having to deal with them at multiple points, each of the listed workaround is additional work for an Org Admin.&#xd;
