We would like to thank you for all the comments and feedback on the bug you've been experiencing with JCMA re-opening closed sprints.\r\n\r\nThis bug and the various ways it occurs (as mentioned in the Description of this bug) is due to {*}Config Drift{*}. JCMA tracks and maintains a record of the entities you have migrated (e.g workflow, custom field etc.), this functionality enables it to reduce the incidence that duplicate entities are created by linking data from entities that have previously been migrated. _*You can learn more about how JCMA links your data [here|https://support.atlassian.com/migration/docs/how-the-jira-cloud-migration-assistant-links-your-data/] & [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/jira-cloud-migration-assistant-duplicates-and-tracking-entities-1063170066.html]*_\r\n\r\nIn this scenario with the sprint entity if there is a *difference (drift)* in the status of the Sprint we have taken the Server/Data Center status as the source of truth which results in the JCMA behaviour you're experiencing. \r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of all the scenarios and uses cases we determined the best approach to solve this bug would be to develop a feature that would enable you to choose the source of truth whenever a *Config Drift* scenario is detected. \r\n\r\nWhile this may not be the outcome you were expecting, changing the source of truth to Cloud may also result in another bug for use cases where the Server/Data Center status would be considered the source of truth some customers.\r\n\r\nYou can monitor progress of this feature via [MIG-2100|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/MIG-2100] we have carried over all your comments and votes there as well.\r\n\r\nPlease share any additional information about your particular use case that you think would help us prioritise building this feature.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nCloud Transitions Team\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen migrating Projects from Server to Cloud, the migration assistant can reopen past completed Sprints in some scenarios. Some well-known scenarios are:\r\n * Sprint name already exists in destination Cloud site (expected as per MIG-1339)\r\n * Sprint was previously migrated under a different name after Project data changed\r\n * Sprint contains cross-project issues\r\n * Shared Sprints found in other Boards\r\n * In phased migrations, if migrator selects on every plan to migrate \"All dashboards\", if a gadget/ dashboard references a sprint, although the sprint belongs to a single project board, will be exported in cross project data and the server data will take prevalence over already existing cloud data;\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible on Data Center: (yes)\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThese steps only account for 1 particular scenario that is very consistent (cross-project issues):\r\n # On Server site, create *Project* A with *Sprint 1* and Issues\r\n # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including *Project A*\r\n # On Cloud site, complete *Sprint 1*\r\n # On Server site, create *Project B* with Issues. Assign an Issue to *Sprint 1*\r\n # Perform a Server to Cloud migration using JCMA including only *Project B*\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nConsidering *Project A* was not in the scope of the migration, this should have no impact, OR a new *Sprint 1* should be created in {*}Project B{*}.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n*Sprint 1* from *Project A* is reopened. This is also still applicable if the Sprint was renamed in the Server site where it will update the Sprint name in the Cloud site.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf migrating in phases with the option to migrate \"All dashboards\" in each phase, prior to the migration, contact Atlassian Migration Support with the result of the below query:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT\r\n    pp.ID AS DashboardID,\r\n    pp.PAGENAME AS DashboardName,\r\n    pc.ID AS GadgetID,\r\n    pc.GADGET_XML AS GadgetKey,\r\n    gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE AS SprintID,\r\n    aosp.\"NAME\" AS SprintName,\r\n    aosp.\"START_DATE\" AS SprintStartDate,\r\n    aosp.\"COMPLETE_DATE\" AS SprintCompleteDate,\r\n    aosp.\"END_DATE\" AS SprintEndDate,\r\n    aosp.\"CLOSED\" AS SprintClosed,\r\n    aosp.\"STARTED\" AS SprintStarted,\r\n    aosp.\"RAPID_VIEW_ID\" AS RapidViewID \r\n    FROM\r\n       PORTALPAGE pp\r\n   JOIN\r\n       PORTLETCONFIGURATION pc ON pp.ID = pc.PORTALPAGE\r\n   JOIN\r\n       GADGETUSERPREFERENCE gup_sprint ON pc.ID = gup_sprint.PORTLETCONFIGURATION AND gup_sprint.USERPREFKEY = 'sprintId'\r\n   JOIN\r\n       \"AO_60DB71_SPRINT\" aosp ON gup_sprint.USERPREFVALUE = aosp.\"ID\"::text;\r\n{code}\r\nAtlassian support will be able to map the above result with the existing cloud data and will provide you the differences for the potentially impacted sprints. Having this information, migrator can take educated decision on whether to proceed in using the migrate \"All dashboard\" option with impact or not migrating dashboards (as long as all dashboards were migrated in the first migration phase). More than this, the information provided can be leveraged to modify the on premise sprints via REST/ API or database ( by setting to the on prem sprints the values existing on cloud).","createDate":"2024-06-10T13:20:53.000+0000","comments":[{"text":"{panel:title=Atlassian Update – 19 November 2024|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#deebff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis is Aayushi from the JCMA team.

Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no automated workaround for this behavior.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an issue has a Parent Link and its issue type is changed to a type on another hierarchy level, the Parent Link data remains. Consequently, the Parent Link is still visible on the issue view with a warning icon that suggests the Parent Link violates the current Hierarchy configuration and should be updated by the user.\r\n\r\nThis issue is worsened when an Epic Link is also present on the Issue that had the Issue Type changed. The presence of an Epic Link makes Jira automatically hide the Parent Link from the Screens and makes it harder to remove the leftover data.\r\n\r\nThis issue can lead to unexpected and unusual behaviour in Jira. For instance, JQL queries may produce results that differ from what is anticipated. For example, 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over the Issue hierarchy ({*}linkedIssuesOfRecursive{*}) and can return a different set of issues than Jira functions like({*}childIssuesOf{*}).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1*\r\n # Create a new issue type called 'Initiative'\r\n # Configure the hierarchy to be above Epic (at the top level)\r\n # Create a new issue with the issue type 'Initiative'\r\n # Link an Epic to the new Initiative using the parent link\r\n # Open the Epic and use More > Move to change the issue type to 'Initiative'\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2 (inconsistent results returned from childIssuesOf(...) query)*\r\n # Create a new project.\r\n # Configure the hierarchy like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n- EpicBusiness\r\n-- Capability\r\n--- Epic\r\n----Story \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA) The experienced Issue follows the below scenario ...\r\n - The Capability CAP-100 has the EpicBusiness EPB-100 as Parent.\r\n - The Epic EP-100 has CAP-100 as Parent\r\n - The JQL\r\nissue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)\r\nreturns CAP-100 and all its child : Epic (EP-100), User Story (...), Sub-Task (...)\r\n\r\nB) A user move CAP-100 as an EpicBusiness : EPB-110\r\n - The JQL\r\nissue in childIssuesOf(EPB-110)\r\nreturns always same children as when it was CAP-100\r\n - The Epic EP-100 has EPB-110 as direct Parent, an EpicBusiness ! Normally, only Capabilities should be allowed as Parent of Epic\r\n - The JQL\r\nissue in childIssuesOf(EPB-100)\r\nreturns always same children, including EPB-110 (ex-CAP-100) ! Normally, an EpicBusiness can not have a EpicBusiness as Parent.\r\n\r\nIt is causing many inconsistencies in the users activities\r\n\r\n*Scenario 3 (involved 3rd party plugin)*\r\n\r\n*1.* Install a 3rd party app that provides JQL functions to iterate over Issue hierarchy\r\n\r\n*2.* Create Issue Types \"Initiative\" and \"Capability\" and add them to a Project's Scheme\r\n\r\n*3.* Add the Parent Link Custom Field to all Screens on that Project (to make it easier to follow the steps)\r\n\r\n*4.* Configure the Roadmaps Hierarchy so that Initiative > Capability > Epic\r\n\r\n*5.* Create a set of Issues organized as such:\r\n{code:none}\r\nInitiative 1\r\n  Capability 1\r\n    Epic 1\r\n\t  Story 1\r\n  Capability 2\r\n    Epic 2\r\n\t  Story 2\r\n\r\nEpic 3\r\n  Story 3\r\n{code}\r\n*6.* Create a Filter using the 3rd party app JQL function to list the Hierarchy of the top Issue, like:\r\n{code:none}\r\nissue = \"<Initiative 1 Issue Key>\" OR issueFunction in linkedIssuesOfRecursive(\"<Initiative 1 Issue Key>\", \"is parent of\")\r\n{code}\r\n*7.* Confirm all Issues under the hierarchy of \"Initiative 1\" are listed\r\n\r\n*8.* Change the Issue Type of \"Capability 2\" to Story (Move operation also works) and set it's Epic Link to \"Epic 3\"\r\n\r\n*9.* Reload the Filter and see \"Capability 2\" (now a Story) is still being listed, though it's now in the Hierarchy of \"Epic 3\", not under \"Initiative 1\"\r\n\r\nIf you use Jira's native JQL functions, the Epic Link has precedence over the (invalid) Parent Link and \"Capability 2\" is not listed anymore:\r\n{code:none}\r\nissue = \"<Initiative 1 Issue Key>\" OR issue in childIssuesOf(\"<Initiative 1 Issue Key>\")\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n- The parent link will be cleared as you should be able to only link an issue to a parent issue of the _corresponding hierarchy level_ that you've configured for your plan.\r\n- A Move Issue with change of Type (in Roadmap Hierarchy) must break all Parent Links or be blocked while a Parent-Child link exists\r\n- A Move Issue between JSW Issue Types and JPO Issue Types should be follow same rule\r\n- The JQL childIssueOf() should return children in respect of Hierarchies. Parent Link between Issue Type in same Level hierarchy should be ignored.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * The parent link data remains and the warning below can be seen next to this field:\r\n{code}\r\nThis link is inconsistent with your Portfolio hierarchy.\r\n{code}\r\n * The parent link can't be edited as there is still Epic Link\r\n * The \"Capability\" Issue has a valid Epic Link which is prioritized by Jira and an invalid Parent Link which is ignored.\r\n * The data is still left over in both DB tables:\r\n{code:java}\r\nissuelink\r\nentity_property {code}\r\n* The JQL childIssueOf() return the same results after move the ticket to another parent hierarchy issue type.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh4. 1. Create an automation to remove the Parent Link\r\n\r\nCreate an automation rule that will automatically clear the *Parent Link* field whenever an issue is moved to a new issue type, as explained in the KB article linked below:\r\n * [Automation For Jira - How to clear the Parent Link field when an issue is moved to a new type|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1206795140]\r\n\r\nh4. 2.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen the users perform a valid “Search” operation in the “What do you need help with?” input field, search results are getting updated below the respective input field and for invalid search operations the message such as \"No matching search results\" displayed on the page which is not announced by screen reader. The programmatic means of identifying the presence of search result messages and suggestions are not used, so assistive technologies such as screen readers are not able to alert users to the presence of the status message/search results. Although this interaction is easier to understand for sighted users, it is not intuitive for the visually impaired.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nApply the following changes\r\n * Ensure that the search results/status messages that become available when the user search for inputted data in the “What do you need help with?” input field should get announced by the screen reader.\r\n * Provide the aria-live region for the search result message such as \"No matching search results\" which becomes available when the user performs an invalid search operation.\r\n * Screen reader users should be notified when the suggestions get updated in the below along with the count of suggestions. For eg: “ 4 results found” Live regions can be used to achieve this behaviour.\r\n * If this is not feasible, a hidden instruction should be announced (when the search input receives focus), notifying the users of the dynamic change. For eg: Typing letters in the search input fields update the search results, press the tab key to view the list of suggestions.”.\r\n\r\nh3.
